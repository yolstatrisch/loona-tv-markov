00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.660
ViVi: Hello~
HaSeul: Hello~

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.180
HaSeul: The music video shooting!

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.540
HaSeul: Wait, no!

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.320
HaSeul: Orbit!

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.320
HaSeul: Oh, it’s not Orbit...

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.860
(ViVi is embarrassed about seeing HaSeul making many mistakes)
HaSeul: It’s favOriTe!

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.360
HaSeul: Cut, cut!

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.940
HaSeul: Today is the day of music video filming for ‘favOriTe’
ViVi: Yeah

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.760
HaSeul: We were practicing choreography...

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.060
HaSeul: Because we need to practice it more

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.780
HaSeul: And of course, we shouldn’t forget dance moves while filming

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.220
(Some girls are practicing under the hot sun!)

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.040
(Some girls are practicing indoors!)

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.620
(Meanwhile, ‘Love&amp;Live’ by LOOΠΔ 1/3 is playing on the set)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.560
(Of course HeeJin’s beauty is glowing today even though it’s indoor...)

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.900
(HeeJin singing)

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.880
(And YeoJin jumping!)

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.320
HeeJin: This song’s concept is a little harder than ‘Hi High’

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.880
HeeJin: However, YeoJin, you’ve only done something cute

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.740
HeeJin: Our youngest, can you do it well?

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.800
(Of course YeoJin is perfectly good at doing something cute!)

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.720
(YeoJin will get used to ‘favOriTe! So please look forward to it!)
