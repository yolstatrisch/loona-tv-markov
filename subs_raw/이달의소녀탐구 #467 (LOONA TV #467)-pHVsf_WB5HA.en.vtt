Go Won: Becasue we are most special members~

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.100

Olivia Hye: Actually, we're the members who are most sensitive to the cold

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.000
Olivia Hye: But... Iceland...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.400

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.520

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040
