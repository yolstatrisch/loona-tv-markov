(YeoJin covered '여우야' and she choreographed herself)

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.680
(And it's YeoJin's dance cover of 'Doll's that went viral!)

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.660
(And the secret of secret member HaSeul made an appearance!)

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.800
YeoJin: Why are you here?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.460
Chuu: Hey!
HaSeul: Yeah

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.180

Chuu: Explain what's happening, please~

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.780
HaSeul: Cause I'm a secret member like you guys~

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.680
YeoJin: Feeling betrayed!

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.320
(YeoJin, Choerry, Chuu are obviously embarrassed!)
YeoJin: Suddenly 'the moon rises' came out and she showed out of nowhere!

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.580
