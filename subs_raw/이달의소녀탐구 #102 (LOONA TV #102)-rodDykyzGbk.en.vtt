00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.480
HaSeul : We’ve just arrived in Busan!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.020
(But ViVi looks tired…)

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.680
HaSeul : ViVi said to me like…

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.320
HaSeul : ‘Busan looks like Singapore!’ so I asked her

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.960
HaSeul : ‘Ah, have you been to Singapore?’

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.080
HaSeul : And then she said ‘No~’

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.680
(ViVi has reverse charms…)

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.040
HaSeul : It’s cool and rainy here...

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.480
HaSeul : I don’t know how longer the curse of HaSeul will continue

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
ViVi : (Praying to HaSeul) I hope it doesn’t rain

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.900
(HaSeul, the girl of rain and wind)

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.020
HaSeul : Okay~~

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.520
HaSeul : Okay, now I know what you want~

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.520
HaSeul : I’ll just try so hard

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.180
(The photo shoot will start soon!)

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.260
ViVi : Fighting!
