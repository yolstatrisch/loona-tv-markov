00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.820
JinSoul: This background is...

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.860
JinSoul: I realized it after I monitored it

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.620
JinSoul: I mean it looks like Hong Kong

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.780
inSoul: Hong Kong!!

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.240
(This is the insert that was filmed at that time in Hong Kong!)

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.620
(Today's theme of LOOΠΔ TV is the journey back in time!)

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.000
HeeJin: Look at that!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.860
HeeJin: Then you can find the structure

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.780
HeeJin: That is appeared in the music video for Yves' 'new'!

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.040
(The last time the girls came here was in midwinter!)

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.120
Kim Lip: When we came here the last time, the weather was really cold.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.680
Kim Lip: So we were shivering with cold.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.480
Kim Lip: But it's not winter now, so it's very hot~

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.240
(Where is the next place to remind of their memories?)

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.420
HeeJin: Look, there is an apartment.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.120
HeeJin: Do you remember the last scene of 'Egoist' that me and Olivia Hye meet?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.600
HeeJin: The scene was filmed at the apartment

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.940
(Of course the weather of the day was very cold...)

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.460
HeeJin: However, now we're trying to overcome the heat

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.960
HeeJin: Em....

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.620
HeeJin: Everything became a memory
