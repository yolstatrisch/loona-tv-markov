00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.320
(It's been a while seeing LOOΠΔ / yyxy's group shot)

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.060
Chuu: HyeJoo here, HyeJoo (the stunt person) there!

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.620
Olivia Hye: Olivia Hye~

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.860
(The stunt person for Olivia Hye's filming is over)

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.280
(What scene LOOΠΔ / yyxy is about to shoot?)

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
(The running scene!)

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.900
Olivia Hye: ViVi, who are you rooting for?

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.100
(But ViVi is so kind so she couldn't tell who she's rooting for)

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.740
(Maybe Chuu's very competitive!!)

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.300
'1, 2, 3'

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.800
'Run!'

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.680
(Yves standing out among others)

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.440
'Wow, Yves~'

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.900
ViVi: So... Yves is really...

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.660
ViVi: fast...

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.780
'This is good. We need this running feeling'

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.780
'These two ran very well'

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.880
'However these....'

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.580
'You guys need to run faster than this, okay?'

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.740
'Just a little faster'

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.620
'The distance between them is too far to shoot together even in a single frame!'

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.440
Yves: She said she was also in track and field~

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.809
Olivia Hye: But I just did the high jump, not running~
Yves; (Emotionless) Oh~
