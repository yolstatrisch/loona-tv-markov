ViVi wants to run in LOOΠΔ's new gym clothes!
ViVi : Hello~

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.060
ViVi : I want to run at the shooting site today~

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.280
But it keeps on raining

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.640
ViVi : It's still raining... still bad weather...

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.080
ViVi : Rain.... I don't like you....

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.620
HaSeul : Now... it's stopped raining for a while

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.980
HaSeul : We have to film every scenes what we planned today!

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.620
HaSeul : I'm so worried

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.680
ViVi is trying her best, although the weather is bad

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.080
'How about running, ViVi'

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.280
ViVi : Running?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.940
ViVi : I love it!

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.880
HeeJin : It's time to film a group dance scene~

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.100
HeeJin : I was thinking 'when is this rain supposed to let up?', but fortunately it's stopped now!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.580
The scene wasn't used for "Love&amp;Live" MV, but the girls did their best!
