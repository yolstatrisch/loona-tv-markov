00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.200
(LOOΠΔ TV PREQUEL AGAIN!)
Yves: It's a historical day for LOOΠΔ

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.480
Yves: Because....

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.040
Yves: Our 12th girl is in here...!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.600
(Go Won is also blurred... Sorry, Go Won...)
Yves: Shall we get into it with our new member, Go Won?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.360
(Here come blurred girls!)

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.760
Yves: How about doing like this? Maybe we can erase the blur!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.220
I did like that last time... but...

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.280
Did you see that?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.080
'It's been a while since you two were in the camera, right?'

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.020
(This blurred girl was appeared in LOOΠΔ TV before!)
Yves: I said 'I'm not cold' and she said 'I'm a bit cold' at that LOOΠΔ TV episode.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.320
Yves: Why did you change your mind so easily?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.300
'You took photos with LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE, right?'
Yes!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.340
But this time, I'm taking photos with 3/3~

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.760
Well... maybe you can think I just showed up out of nowhere,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.800
But that's not...

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.960
(Although it was the last test photo shooting, the girls had a lot of fun together!)
Chuu: Chuu PD's LOOΠΔ TV~

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.500
(Although it was the last test photo shooting, the girls had a lot of fun together!)

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.520
Fighting!
Yves: PD, it's too hard to blur, right?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.480
(Nope. My blurring skill is on another level like AI)

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.920
Yves: Cheer up, PD~
