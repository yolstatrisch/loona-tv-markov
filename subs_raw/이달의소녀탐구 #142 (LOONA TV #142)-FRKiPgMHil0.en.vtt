Hello~

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.940
My feet hurt...

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.000
The shoes are really tight because my feet are swollen...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.820
It's alright

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.360
I can do well!

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.160
Lip~ fight on!

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.280
(KIm Lip withstanding her feet and doing her best to the very end!)

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.520
(Having to dance all day for the MV that is dance-focused...)

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.580
(The "Eclipse" MV shoot is finally complete!!)

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.220
Thank you for your work~

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.720
Thank you!

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.980
We're done!!

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.980
(How was it?)

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.020
So many people have put in the effort for this one MV...

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.180
And I was so touched seeing everyone work so hard

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.400
to help me look this beautiful...!

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.460
This is a quite different concept from the usual LOOΠΔ

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.840
When my album is released

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.960
Please listen to it a lot and show us your encouragement!

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.540
Bye~

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.720
Show it lots of love~!!
