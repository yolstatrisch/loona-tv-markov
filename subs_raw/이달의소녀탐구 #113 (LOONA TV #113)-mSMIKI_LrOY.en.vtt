00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.360
HeeJin : The only thing left is…

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.340
HaSeul : The flyer miles!!

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.320
HeeJin : But I couldn’t earn miles until now..

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.280
HaSeul : We didn’t earn frequent flyer miles.. because we were so busy..

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.240

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.180
HeeJin : The Curse of HaSeul!

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.700
