00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.520
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ - favOriTe"
(It looks like lunch time at school)

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.380
(And coincidentally, the members out there are Chuu, Choerry and YeoJin)

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.860
(Suddenly Yves appeared!)

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.020
'Why are they so excited?'

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.620
(They are so enegetic today, and It looks awkward even to LOOΠΔ TV PD!)

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.480
(Do you know the reason why they keep taking a pose like that?)

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.520
(Because of HeeJin's commercial which became a hot issue recently!)
HeeJin: Focus

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.600
JinSoul: You can try, YeoJin!

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.000
YeoJin: Focus~!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.420
JinSoul: Oh, come on~

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.260
YeoJin: Focus~!

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.840
(The fans watching it would be focused on her definitely!)
YeoJin: Focus~!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.660
(The fans watching it would be focused on her definitely!)

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.080
HeeJin: Stop it~

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.800
(It's JinSoul's turn!)

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.760
(It's JinSoul's turn!)
JinSoul: Focus~

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.440
HeeJin: She doesn't know what is 'Focus'

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.140
(Maybe she doesn't really know it...)

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.680
HeeJin: I'm sure! She doesn't know it!

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.580
JinSoul: Choerry doesn't know it~

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.460
Choerry: I know, I know!

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.100
HeeJin: Definitely she doesn't know it!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.940
Yves: I can do!

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.880
Yves: Please, I can do!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.720
Yves: Let me try~!

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.280
(Attention all the advertisers, this is Yves!)

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.680
(This is the dignity of the original)
HeeJin: Just try to be chic and cool as much as you can

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.000
(Okay, HeeJin. We're getting focused!)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.660
JinSoul: Okay, let's try it together!

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
(Now you can understand LOOΠΔ TV #375.5, right?)
