Kim Lip: See you!

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.900
(2 AM... Is it real...?)

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.340
JinSoul: You know? I'm so tired

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.080
JinSoul: because it's 2 AM...

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.980
Kim Lip: I'm OK... But after 1 hour, maybe I'll be like...

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.780
(Pretending to sleep)

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.860
JinSoul: It is kind of like braided hair!

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.680
Kim Lip: It's a special way to put waves in the hair.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.220
Kim Lip: Maybe you watched this curled hair in ViVi's "Everyday I Need You" music video!

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.520

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.800
Kim Lip: Can you get pretty pictures?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.500
JinSoul: I hope my face will be looking good...

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.280
Kim Lip: Are you going to sleep now?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.960
JinSoul: Yes!

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.340
JinSoul: My eyes are bloodshot

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.800
JinSoul: But it will be fine if I sleep enough

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.100
Kim Lip: I think we might have to protect her eyes

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.720
Kim Lip: So we're going to bed now!

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.540
