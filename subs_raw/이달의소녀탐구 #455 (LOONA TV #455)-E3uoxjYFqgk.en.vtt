00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.080
Chuu: Did you drink this? (Calming drink, Cheongsimhwan)
Choerry: No~

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.860
Choerry: I don't need this~

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.140
YeoJin: I'm not nervous yet~

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.840
'The audience doesn't know yest who are the secret members?'

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.540
(Loss of words...)

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.840
(But everyone already know who are the secret members)
Chuu: Of course~ I gues nobody knows~

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.280
(Although it's not secret anymore, cheer up! Try your best!)

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.340
(However, there was another secret member that nobody expected)

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.420
(The secret member is hiding behind the rear door and the manager is trying to open it!)

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.360
(It's front door, not rear door!)
'I'm here!'

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.480
(It's front door, not rear door!)
'Ah, there you are!'

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.380
(It's HaSeul!)
HaSeul: Hello~

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.720
HaSeul: Hurry up~

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.060
HaSeul: I'm a secret of secret member for YeoJin + Secret members Studio!

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.020
HaSeul: Even the members don't know about it~

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.960
HaSeul: I'm about to go up on stage~

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.700
HaSeul: Very curious to see how they react to this!

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.680
HaSeul: (HaSeul's Instinct of PD) So director, film their reaction well, please!

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.040
HaSeul: Cause I also want to see~

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.820
HaSeul: I think I have to go now!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.960
(Suddenly 'Let Me In' playing from somewhere else!)

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560
(Suddenly 'Let Me In' playing from somewhere else!)
'We, so different us two'

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.020
(How Yeo,Choe,Chuu will react to HaSeul's unexpected appearance?)
