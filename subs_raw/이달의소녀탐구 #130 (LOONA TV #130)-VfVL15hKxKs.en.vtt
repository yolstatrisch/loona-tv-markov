00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.500
(They are on their way to the next set)

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.920
I want to eat pizza

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.300
I more like pizza than fried chicken!

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.800
Jokbal (Pork hock)

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.640
Bossam (Napa wraps with pork)

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.300
Jajangmyun (Black bean noodles)

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.800
Tangsuyuk (Sweet and Sour Pork)

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.660
Lamb skewers and Guobaorou are so delicious

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.920
(They’re singing LOOΠΔ 1/3’s “Love&amp;Live”)

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.220
We’re doing good, right?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.260
(They’ve arrived the next place!)

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.080
It looks like a foreign country

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.320
I want to go abroad

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.540
I want to hang out

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.240
Did you think that you will go abroad like other members did?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.680
Yeah, I slightly expected that...

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.460
But they told me that you don’t go abroad...

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.680
So I said.. ‘Okay!’

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.320
Where did you want to go?

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.560
Paris!

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.620
Because..

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.820
HeeJin looked really pretty

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.600
and the girls had a lot of delicious food in Paris...

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.260
And…. I envied HaSeul. Because she’s been to Iceland

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.420
Seeing an aurora isn’t easy, right?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.480
I really want to see an aurora before I die

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.040
But HaSeul saw that. So I envied her a bit

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.800
(Maybe you will go abroad someday! Good luck!)
