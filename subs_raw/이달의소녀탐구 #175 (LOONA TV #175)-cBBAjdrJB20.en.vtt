(The members are gathered in the lobby early in the morning!)

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.640

Choerry: First of all...

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.040

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.820
Choerry: And today...
Kim Lip: By the way, what if it rains?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.140
HaSeul: Anyway, shall we go to start Choerry's MV shooting?
Choerry: Sure!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.380
(It’s not raining, but it's a little cloudy. )

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.680
HaSeul: Are you ready, Choerry?
Choerry: Of course!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.700

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.620
(The music video shoot has started and Choerry doing passionately!)

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.360
(By the way… It’s raining suddenly as soon as filming started)

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.315
Choerry: It started to rain…

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.040
Choerry: I think it’s HaSeul…

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.660
Choerry: HaSeul’s curse again..

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.860
HaSeul: I’m sorry!

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.160
HaSeul: I didn’t expected it, but it’s raining again…

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560
HaSeul: From now on, you better not take me to the outside filming or shooting, except a studio shooting...
