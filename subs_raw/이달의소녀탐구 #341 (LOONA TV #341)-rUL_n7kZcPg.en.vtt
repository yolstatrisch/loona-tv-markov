00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.860
(The first morning of Budapest)

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.140
Chuu: We're about to go to a set for a photo shoot!

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.160
Chuu: It's started actually.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.420
(When you start to do something, you should listen 'Eclipse' by Kim Lip!)
Olivia Hye: It has started, Eclipse~
Chuu: Lip~

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.940
Chuu: Our older members, I mean Yves and Go Won...

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.840
Chuu: Go Won? Oops!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.340
(Yves and Go Won are also here!)

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.640
Yves: This is our breakfast~
Go Won: Right~

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.300
Yves: I guess it matches well with this costume.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.500
Yves: Shall I throw it?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.320
(Yves wants to throw apples whenever she sees it)

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.340
(Anyway, they arrived the location for the first photo shoot!)

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.880
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ/yyxy - rendezvous 18.6y"

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.460
(Today's probs are hamburgers!)

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.260
Go Won: Looks delicious~

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.120
Chuu: And a lot of beef...

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.560
(Go Won seemed very interested in the food!)

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.940
(It looks really delicious...)

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.420
Go Won: It's hard to endure!

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.780
Go Won: I wanted to eat all up!

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.555
Go Won: However I couldn't do that because it's a photo shooting~
