00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.780
(1 year ago, October 2nd, Japan)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640
HaSeul is doing a photoshoot with HeeJIn and HyunJin!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.680
(Maybe it was HaSeul’s first LOOΠΔ TV shooting!)
Are you shooting me?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.660
I’m going to check my luggage at there!

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.120
(HaSeul has to go Japan alone as the second party)

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.460
I’m going to Japan two days later after they went there.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.220
You know, I feel stuck...

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.160
(She has to move alone by public transportation!)
Because I’ve never used public transportation in Japan...

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.840
(She worried about many thing before she was revealed as third member...)
There’re many beautiful girls like...

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.700
(She worried about many thing before she was revealed as third member...)
The pretty girl next to the pretty girl…

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.980
But you know, I think I have a kind of unique or characteristic face…

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.280
So I don’t want people to be shocked….

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.380
I hope there’re a lot of people who like my kind of face…

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
(HeeJin’s ViViD wasn’t released at that time)
HeeJin’s single album will be out October 5.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
It’s NEXT WEEK!

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.900
I’m so excited

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.660
Are you shooting me as soon as getting off?

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.600
I’m going to take a subway!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.760
(Then or now, HaSeul is so brave!)

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.680
I’m glad that I’m not alone. 
(*She’s moving with the PD)

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
