00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.700
(Kim Lip and Chuu checking each other's heartbeat)
Chuu: Do not speak!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.100
(Kim Lip and Chuu checking each other's heartbeat)
Chuu: I can' hear your heartbeat

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.320
Kim Lip: Gosh, a piano came out on stage!

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.120
Chuu: Huh! Piano?
Kim Lip: What should I do? I'm scary!

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.360
'Are you going to play a piano today?'

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.600
Kim Lip: (What a twist) Nope
Chuu: Yes~

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.440
Chuu: I do!

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.500
Kim Lip: Oh, right~

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.460
Kim Lip: Cheer up~
Chuu: Her heart is not working, I guess!

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.600
Kim Lip: What? It's working!

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.980
(Actually, her heart was racing so hard all day long!)

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.300
(Of course, JinSoul and Choerry felt nervous as well!)

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.320
JinSoul: I'm really nervous!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.940
JInSoul: Ah~

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.940
JinSoul: So nervous right now~

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.220
Choerry: But you know, we're ODD EYE CIRCLE

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.040
Choerry: We can do well!

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.780
(So, they won't be nervous?)

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.240
(No way, they were so nervous even until they go up on stage!)

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.460
Kim Lip: I've never been so nervous like this
JinSoul: Right, so nervous

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.120
JinSoul: (Suddenly) acting cool!

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.160
JinSoul: (Joke) I'm not nervous at all~
Choerry: (Serious) I'm nervous~

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.120
(But Kim Lip is different...)

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.900
(So Choerry decided to cheer her up!)
Choerry: Okay, you can enjoy it!

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.820
(So Choerry decided to cheer her up!)
Choerry: It would be better if you empty your mind~

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.680
(So Choerry decided to cheer her up!)
JinSoul: No I can't!

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.860
Choerry: Like... 'Okay, just enjoy it'

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.740
Choerry: Ah, did you see that she changed her hair color to black?

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.960
Choerry: I guess fans' response will be pretty hot~

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.620
(She can't hear that now... she's just nervous...)

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.560
JinSoul: I took a calming pill called 'Chungsimhwan' for the first time in my life
Kim Lip: Me too

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.300
Kim Lip: Look, Chuu told me that the calming pill's effect would work depending on the person!

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.440
Kim Lip: So I took it an hour and a half ago!

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.220
Kim Lip: But now I know that I took it too early!

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.340
Jinsoul: You know? I took it too late!

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.017
JinSoul: I wasn't nervous like this even at the debut concert!
