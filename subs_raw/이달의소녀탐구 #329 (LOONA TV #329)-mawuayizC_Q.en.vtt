00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.400
Yves: What scene will you shoot?
Olivia Hye: I am not gonna tell…

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.860
Chuu: Are you curious?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.200
Chuu: Success in matching lines!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.120
Go Won: I’m good at matching lines, too!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
Yves: Right, she’s good at reacting quickly!

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.980
Yves: Park Go Won, 19 years old!

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.460
Yves: Even while we are talking other subject,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.920
Yves: Park Go Won, 19 years old!

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.220
Chuu: Me! 19 years old, PARK. GO. WON!

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.520
(This is the [Matching lines] game!)
Chuu: Going outside~

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.540
(Yves, Chuu, and Go Won running? Is this a scene from ‘One &amp; Only’ music video?)

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.880
Yves: Remember, we’re on the 5 floor

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.460
Yves: And now, we take the elevator.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.940
Yves: We’ll go to the 2nd floor!

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.340
Yves: And then close the doors

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.580
Yves: It should work, right?
Chuu: Right! It should go down!

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.760
Yves: Uh? Is it working?
Chuu: It’s going down?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.980
(Yes. It’s working well…)

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.780
Chuu: Definitely it wasn’t working…

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.220
Chuu: Oh no, oh my…

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.300
Chuu: We became a fool!

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.040
Yves: Okay, let me explain what’s happened.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.260
Yves: A little while ago, it didn’t work when I pushed 2nd floor button.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.720
Chuu: Right! And doors kept opening.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.660
Yves: However, suddenly it worked after we brought the PD here!!

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080
Yves: So now we're on the 2nd floor!

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.720
Yes: I don’t know! What’s happening here!
