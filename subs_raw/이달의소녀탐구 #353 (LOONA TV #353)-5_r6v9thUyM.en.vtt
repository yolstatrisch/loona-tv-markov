(Olivia Hye doing lip sync for her solo scene!)

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.800
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ / yyxy - love4eva (feat. Grimes)"

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.380
Yves: Don't do that 'kidney' part~

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.580
Yves: love4eva ~ even my kidney is pounding

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.840
Yves: Look at this. If you say 'kidney' in this part, it looks so weird.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.500
(The leader of LOOΠΔ / yyxy, Yves takes care of Olivia Hye carefully!)
Yves: So she needs to sing like this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.100
(The leader of LOOΠΔ / yyxy, Yves takes care of Olivia Hye carefully!)
Yves: 'love4eva~ (even my kidney) is pounding~'

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.940
(And Olivia Hye is doing without saying 'kidney' like what Yves said!)

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.820
Olivia Hye: The most difficult thing in the MV filming is doing lip sync!

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.200
Olivia Hye: To be honest, facial expressions are really difficult...

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.820
Yves: You looked so pretty on screen!

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.860
(Yves whispered praise to Olivia Hye's ear!)

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.720
Olivia Hye: (Cute wolf) My ear is purified!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.580
Yves: Olivia Hye was always cute~!
Chuu: Right~

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.260
Olivia Hye: I actually wasn't going for cute.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.360
Olivia Hye: But I definitely did try multiple angles

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.480
Olivia Hye: So, I could do it a little bit easily!

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.300
(It's time to show off your cuteness, Olivia Hye!)

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.900
(One more time!)

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.040
(She suddenly feels ashamed even though she already did all!)

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.720
Olivia Hye: Please edit it out!
