00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.380
Hello, everyone!

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.280
The youngest member of LOOΠΔ!

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.060
Don't tell me that I'm the youngest member 'so far'!

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm gonna be the youngest one of LOOΠΔ forever and ever!

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320
Yeah, that' me. I'm YeoJin!

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.480
Ha.. did you know that?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
Actally I'm that slash of LOOΠΔ 1/3.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.320
When I heard it first, I was really surprised too like you did!

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.920
(She looks so surprised...)

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.760
Anyway, I've come here to celebrate LOOΠΔ TV's 200th episode today!

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.720
But... you saying you didn't miss me?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.460
You really missed and wanted to see all of the members, but not me?

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.960
Ok... I'm gonna quit this.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.860
I'm leaving! Bye!!

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.060
What I prepared for this special episode is...

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.900
The best episode picked by members of LOOΠΔ!

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.660
(Hosting herself, reacting herself

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.100
I called it 'BEST LOOΠΔ TV EPISODE PICKED BY LOOΠΔ'

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.860
BEST LOOΠΔ TV EPISODE PICKED BY LOOΠΔ

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.100
First, I'm gonna tell you about the best episode selected by Choerry,  one of the youngest member of LOOΠΔ!

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.260
It was released recently!

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.180
This is...

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.820
This is the 188th episode!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.680
Kim Lip: I've never ridden these kind of things before!

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.040
Choerry: I've ridden it before, though it's scary!

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
JinSoul: I've never ridden even a pirate ship before. 
Because it's so scary!

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.520
(But you all have to try it this time!)
Choerry: Unbelievable!

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.540
Kim Lip: No! It doesn't make any sense!

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.980
Choerry: No way!

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.000
Kim Lip: So scary!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.480
(They get scared.)

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.400
(But the youngest member looks so happy...)

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.960
JInSoul: We're in LA but...

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660
JinSoul: We've just got this letter~
Kim Lip: We've got this letter~

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.000
(The fan letter was given to them who were on the way back!)
Thank you!

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.140
The reason she chose it her favorite is...

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.060
It was first time to go abroad and Santa Monica beach was amazing. I had a lot of fun with members, especially I could go on the amusement park ride that I really like!

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.900
And the camera captured the moment when I was really happy. So I think it's good episode.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.640
She said like this.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.300
That is the members' true side. I guarantee it.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.160
Look at that facial expressions. That's the real one.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.800
Hey, believe me! Believe in YeoJin Lim, everyone!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.980
TRUST ME!

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.580
Now I'm gonna introduce other member's favorite episode.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.300
The member feels like my mom or like my real sister!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.420
Yes, right. It's HaSeul's best LOOΠΔ TV episode!

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.640
HaSeul : Finally, our LOOΠΔ TV has reached 100th episode!

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.040
HeeJin : I’m so happy about...

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.960
HeeJin : that I’ve made a lot of good memories with members and fans together

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.040
HeeJin : while filming LOOΠΔ TV

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.260
HyunJin : I can’t believe LOOΠΔ TV has reached 100 episodes…

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.940
HyunJin : Also, I'm curious how many more episodes of LOOΠΔ TV will be produced!

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.320
HyunJin : I'm looking forward to it, too!

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.920
YeoJin : We have to do it until #1,000, #10,000~

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.960
HaSeul : (Tackle!) Really?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.700
YeoJin : Yes!! Sure!!!

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.580
I remember this.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.480
How time flies...

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.400
The reason she chose it her favorite is...

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.560
It was first time to see all 5 released members in LOOΠΔ TV and it was really meaningful that LOOΠΔ TV has reached 100th episode!

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.140
She said like this!

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.560
She selected it like the leader, the oldest member!

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.740
I'm already missing you, HaSeul!

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.960
Would you hang out with me today?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm gonna stick to you like a glue until you hanging out with me!

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.380
And!

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.760
There is the other member who chose her favorite episode like HaSeul did!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.020
Aren't you curious who she is?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.440
JINSOUL~!

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.440
Ah~ I think both 97 liners are thinking the same thing!

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.320
♬Happy birthday dear JinSoul. Happy birthday to you♬

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.660
HaSeul: (Her wish) Um... shall we do that? 'This has been LOOΠΔ?'

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.840
(The 7 released members of LOOΠΔ finally gathered together in front of the camera!)
This has been LOOΠΔ!

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.580
Here comes JinSoul's comment!

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.220
It was first time to see all 7 released members in LOOΠΔ TV so it was really meaningful.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.160
And I think you can imagine the whole LOOΠΔ through this scene because more than half members were appeared.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.320
She said like this!

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.320
Yeah, they're really different from me! So reliable!

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.920
So we, the members are gonna believe and follow unnies! Please lead us!

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.640
FOLLOW UNNIES!

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.300
It's time to see the choice of HeeJin, the very first member of LOOΠΔ!

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.220
Check it out now!

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.980
(And LOOΠΔ members practicing along)

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.180
(Especially HeeJin is dancing passionately…)

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.420
(HeeJin acting as the extra instructor)

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.720
(LOOΠΔ’s power dancer is here!)

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.240
HeeJin: Do you want to try that concept?

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.680
HaSeul: I can do sexy too~

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.960
(Should probably stick to the youthful concept…)

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.760
I think I understand why she chose it her favorite episode...

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.540
HeeJin is so pretty, right?

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.220
Her beauty is glowing.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.900
And she is really pretty in person.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.940
So gorgeous!

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.760
But I think she's looking better in episode 138.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.700
Ok. I agree!

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.780
I know you're pretty. I'm envious of you, HeeJin!

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.120
But there is another pretty girl in ODD EYE CIRCLE, the second unit of LOOΠΔ!

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.260
She is Kim Lip!

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.780
As you know, NASA inicluded her track in their Eclipse playlist. Now, let's check what is her best episode!

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.100
Kim Lip: It's so good

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.040
Kim Lip: I really love here~!

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.580
(You have to take a proof shot when you visit the famous place!)

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.340
JinSoul: The sea~

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.520
JInSoul: Now I'm starting to feel like I'm abroad~

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.820
Choerry: (Hurry up!) Let's finish quick!
JinSoul: As quick as possible!

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.880
(They've finished shooting! Let's go to the beach! Go Go!)

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.600
Kim Lip: I really love it!

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm gonna read you Lip's comment!

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.020
It was first time to trip abroad and I was really happy to film in Santa Monica.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.480
Santa Monica became ODD EYE CIRCLE's favorite shooting place. I made a lot of good memories in abroad. This episode remind me of our LA days.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.680
Choerry and Kim Lip both like Santa Monica!

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.240
But Choerry especially likes the last half and Kim Lip likes the first half of Santa Monica episodes!

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.120
But... you know?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.920
Oh my...

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.320
I really want to go Santa Monica as well!!!!

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.940
Send YeoJin to Santa Monica now!!

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.720
I can do better than now, sir!

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.500
Hold on a sec!

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.840
I'll be back after commercials!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.640
No commercials?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.080
Really?

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.500
Oh, I'm sorry~

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.560
Now it's time to watch ViVi's favorite episode!

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.040
ViVi : If you don't play the rock-paper-scissors game,
HaSeul : Yes, I will eat alone

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.380
ViVi : If you win the game, everyone can eat a pizza

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.140
ViVi : But if you lose, you even can't eat too!

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.260
(ViVi understands the rule perfectly)

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.360
HyunJin : Rock-paper-scissors!

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.620
(The first game ended in a tie!)

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.960
(Second round!)
'Rock-paper-scissors!'

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.840
(The second game ended in a tie, again!)

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.160
(The pizza game is getting more interesting!)

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.960
(The winner is LOOΠΔ 1/3!!)

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.540
(It's the most moving moment to LOOΠΔ 1/3)

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.320
HaSeul : Come on, LOOΠΔ!!

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.640
ViVi said she likes it

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.900
Because it's the episode to check LOOΠΔ 1/3's team work and chemistry!

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.840
They're so adorable, right?

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.340
But it looks little sad because it was last filming overseas for LOOΠΔ 1/3...!!

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.380
And next is HyunJin's best LOOΠΔ TV episode!

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.360
Let's check it out!

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.240
(Last costume is the black dress!)

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.200
(The photoshoot in Prague is over!)

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.760
ViVi : The photoshoot is over, today!

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.600
HaSeul : We're done!

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
HaSeul : Yes~ well..!!

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.080
HaSeul : But LOOΠΔ 1/3 is not over yet!

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.980
HyunJin : The whole schedule for the photoshoot is over!

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.020
LOOΠΔ : Good job! Thank you!

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.740
HyunJin picked LOOΠΔ 1/3's almost last episode in Prague.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.800
It's little touching to see that episode again because...

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.180
I realized time has passed so fast after LOOΠΔ 1/3's era ended.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.500
I think we shared a lot of good meories with you through this LOOΠΔ TV.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.620
Am I right?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.560
Right??

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.580
Yeah, we know you're sending lots of love and support for LOOΠΔ and LOOΠΔ TV

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.460
So we're always doing our best to film LOOΠΔ TV!!

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.240
We hope you keep watch and enjoy it!

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.740
We promise you that we'll give you more fun and interesting episodes!

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.660
One and only English subtitled contents in K-POP!

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.140
LOOΠΔ TV!

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.080
(YeoJin... It's not sure....)
Oh... it's not sure...?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.600
(She apologizes again!)
Oh... I'm sorry...

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.320
Finally, it's time to see the best episode of me, MC YeoJin!

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.100
YeoJin : I think you have a great fashion sense.
HaSeul : Of course

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.580
HaSeul : This is REAL FASHION!

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.700
HaSeul : What's your the key point of your fashion today?
YeoJin : The mask

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.860
HaSeul : YeoJin, turn around now!

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.320
(HaSeul and YeoJin cannot be still even for a moment...)

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.640
YeoJin : You're watching

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.560
YeoJin : Haseul is hitting me with the belt!!

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.780
HyunJin : Yo, I'm going to show you my rap

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.940
(It's street dance skill that HeeJin has been hiding!)

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.180
(It's street dance skill that HeeJin has been hiding!)
HaSeul : The girl is a rare beauty!

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.780
I think the episode would be nothing if I didn't wear that mask.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.100
It is the most interesting episode for me!

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.500
Because you can see the rap battle between HyunJin and HaSeul

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.660
And also you can see that HaSeul hits me with her belt!

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.640
I think those scenes are perfectly, gracefully, and magically well mixed into this episode like...Olivia Hussey(?)

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.400
Well.. this has been the 200th episode with the special host, YeoJin MC!

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.480
How was it?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.480
Was it fun?

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.480
(Hypnotizing you) Yes. I'm sure It was fun to you.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.720
Because it was fun to me.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.080
I hope you enjoyed it!

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.360
(YeoJin's hidden talent: Hosting the show)

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.280
And all blurred girls in LOOΠΔ TV Preauel will be revealed in the near future~

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.820
I'd like to film LOOΠΔ TV with all of them! I can't wait for the day to come!

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.520
And.. how do you think I did on the show today?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.620
Was it good?

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.340
Of course I know that my hosting is not good enough yet.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.820
Hope you kindly understand!

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:51.840
Me, YeoJin MC, will keep breaking into LOOΠΔ TV and show you lots of fun things!

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.960
So please look forward to it!

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.600
Until now, that slash of LOOΠΔ 1/3!!!

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.960
Jin slash!

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.060
The real youngest member of LOOΠΔ so far!

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.540
This was MC YeoJin!

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.200
See you~!
