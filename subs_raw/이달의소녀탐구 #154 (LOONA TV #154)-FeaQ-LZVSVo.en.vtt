Kim Lip: Today is her birthday and..

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.480
Kim Lip: fist MV filming day.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.620
JinSoul: And also the day which her first teaser image was released

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.760
Kim Lip: She was so pretty in the picture

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.180
JinSoul: MV filming is a totally new experience for me

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.600
JinSoul: So I'm feeling nervous, excited, and my heart is dribbling(?)...

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.060
JimSoul: Oh my gosh... I said 'dribbling'

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.380
JinSoul: My heart is fluttering now

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.400
JinSoul: That's how I feel

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.960
JinSoul: I'll do my best today!

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.080
Kim Lip: Do your best, JinSoul! Cheer up!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.480
(Their hearts flutter as they're heading over to the set for MV)

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.320
Kim Lip: Wow... This place is so cool...

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.240
JinSoul: A water tank?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.980
Kim Lip: I heard that JinSoul will go in here and film the MV

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.080
JinSoul: Because my representative animal is a fish.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.220
Kim Lip: You are a real live mermaid, right?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.720
JinSoul: But... the mermaid is trapped in this water tank.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.980
(The water thank scene in the MV is more beautiful than they thought!)

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.760
JinSoul: Well, we'll come back after putting on make up.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.920
