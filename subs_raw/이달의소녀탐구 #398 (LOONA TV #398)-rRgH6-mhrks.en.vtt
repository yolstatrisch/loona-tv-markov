Olivia Hye: I heard that!

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.060
Oilvia Hye: I'm going to film that jumping from the top of that towards you, Yves~

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.280
Yves: Like doing knee kick!!

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.860
(She's doing a joke everytime...)

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.240
Olivia Hye: I'm not sure whether I have to do knee kick or jump towards Yves~

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.360
(This iconic scene from 'Hi High' music video. Aren't you curious how it was shot?)

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.180
Yves: A stunt person is coming...

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.960
Yves: However...

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.700
Yves: I hope...

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.880
Yves: You will do without others to help you

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.460
Olivia Hye: Of course I can jump only if you receive me on your own!

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.280
(They do high five when there are nothing much to say!)

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.520
(Preparing safety equipment)

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.700

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.280

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.360
Olivia Hye: Wow....

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.580
Olivia Hye: I don't think I can do it

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.260
(Chuu and Go Won came here to show support!

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860
(An overwhelming sound!)

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.860
Chuu: You're amazing~

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.920
Chuu: We all shook with fear even when we climbed to the first floor~

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.720
(Thank you so much for you hard work!)
