(The second day of LOONA Studio and it snowed for the first time this winter!)

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.560
JinSoul: Oh!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.460
(JinSoul, the master of acting!)

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.800
Choerry: It's been a very long time since we filmed LOOΠΔ TV~

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.060
Choerry: So we all don't figure out yet what should we do now~

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.300
JinSoul: Okay, it's 9:27 in the morning

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.240
JinSoul: We woke up at 4:30 am

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.260
Choerry: And the first snow fell today~

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.020
JinSoul: Yes~
Chuu: Yeah~

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.880
Choerry: I saw that outside, but I was a bit concerned

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.020
Choerry: that our fans were already lined up outside, too!

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.520
(Meanwhile, Kim Lip changed her hair color!)

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040
Kim Lip: I didn't expect that I would change my hair color to this!
Chuu: Yeah!

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.500
(She also changed color contact lenses to match her hair color!)

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.760
Kim Lip: However, this hair color would familiar to Chuu than the old one!
Chuu: Right~

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.360
Chuu: Actually, her white hair(?) seemed a bit strange to me~

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.920
Chuu: This black hair seems familiar to me!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.780
Kim Lip: Okay~

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.800
Chuu: Why are you looking?
Kim Lip: Say something!

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.580
Chuu: What?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.640
Kim Lip: I just said 'say something'!

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.640
(Chuu bothering Kim Lip, however Kim Lip doesn't care!)

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.420
Chuu: There is a camera in front of us...

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.960
(This is how the real friends do!)
