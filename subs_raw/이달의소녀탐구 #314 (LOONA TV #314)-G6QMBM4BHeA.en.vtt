Olivia Hye: Hello, I'm Olivia Hye, the 12th member of LOOΠΔ!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.400
Choerry: (Same age) My friend!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.120
HaSeul: Please say anything!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.720
HaSeul: Choerry, please wink in front of the camera.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.340
(Winking Choerry, such a veteran of filming LOOΠΔ TV!)

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.060
HaSeul: Olivia Hye, would you do that for us?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.160
Olivia Hye: I'm not good at winking...

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.020
Olivia Hye: However, I'm gonna practice...

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.300
HaSeul: Hey, don't be serious.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.820
HaSeul: That's exactly not what LOOΠΔ TV wants.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.980
HaSeul: Loud sound is the best for LOOΠΔ TV

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.680
(No... That's not it...)

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.260
Choerry: No, don't do this~

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.300
Choerry: Which animal do you want to have as representative animal?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.080
Executive Director : Turtle!

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.160
Olivia Hye: Tur..turtle?

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.960
JinSoul: Blackbird?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.400
HaSeul: Then you always have to be elegant like a blackbird!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480
(Olivia Hye posing gracefully!)

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.220
HaSeul: You're pretty good~

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.140
HaSeul: (HaSeul's LOOΠΔ TV started!) The shooting is just started!

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.700
Olivia Hye: It's heavier than I expected!

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.100
Olivia Hye: I don't know anything yet~

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.980
Olivia Hye: Because I didn't hear anything about this...

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.940
Olivia Hye: I'll do well, right?

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.120
HaSeul: Say anything what you want and end the recording with 'Dang!'

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.560
Olivia Hye: Do I have to say the word 'Dang'?
HaSeul: No!

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.940
(Please look forward to how Olivia Hye is getting used to LOOΠΔ TV!)
