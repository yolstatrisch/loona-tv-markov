00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.180
(HeeJin and Yves who are practicing the choreography of 'Hi High' are found)
'As you see, they're practicing hard'

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.640
(Two girls really love this feeling!)

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.520
Choerry: The members of LOOΠΔ always practice dancing really hard!

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.500
Choerry: Okay, what's the point of this choreography?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.180
HeeJin: Actually, there're too many highlight parts to pick just one thing up~

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.820
Yves: I think the point is... the last part.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.960
Yves: You know, the part that we all come out front and kick like this one time and~

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.400
Yves: Start the engine like this~

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.660
(From now, the name of this part is the engine starting dance!)

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.560
Yves: I think this moves are really suitable for the title of the song~

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.300
Yves: And we feel most excited at this part~
HeeJin: Yeah!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.260
Choerry: Ah~ right!

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.140
HeeJin: We do a windmill excitingly with our arms like this!!

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.500
(The name is changed again! The windmill dance!)

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.440
Yves: The kicking part is my most favorite one!!

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.780
Yves: Because I kick higher like this!
Choerry: Oh, right!

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.320
HeeJin: Hey, you're not trying to put some emotion when you kick, right?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.760
Choerry: There is HeeJin's solo dance, right?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.600
HeeJin: What was it?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.020
Choerry: It looks like a kind of contemporary dance~

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.540
(You all know which dance Choerry is talking, right?)

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.740
Yves: It's a killer part, definitely!

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.360
HeeJin: Like a swan!

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060
(Dancing like a swan in front of the swan Yves!)

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.300
HeeJin: Of course I know that Yves is a swan~
Choerry: Yeah

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.240
Yves: No, I'm going to do this!

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.920
(She starts the engine with a strong feeling!)

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.559
(Then see you next time!)
