00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.800
(The closed school looks really scary...)

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.680
Choerry: It's really scary here

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.920
HaSeul: I think ghosts might live here...

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.300
HaSeul: When we go inside there, they will stick to us and say like 'why are you guys so happy?'

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.280
Choerry: (Queen of positivity) No~ Please think it in a positive way!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.120
Choerry: I think... The ghost would think well of me~

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.520
Choerry: And... the ghost could say like 'Cheer up, you're doing well~!'

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.140
(But...)

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.240
(The real problem they face is a mosquito, not a ghost!)

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.720
Kim Lip: Oh no, Mosquitoes!

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.040
Kim Lip: I've got a mosquito bite on my face, too!

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.900
Choerry: Don't touch...

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.880
(Of course, staffs are having the same problems...)

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.780
(Here is the 1st Jeju Mosquito Festival!)

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.260
Choerry: Mosquito prevention measure!

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.400
Choerry : Shake your body like this~!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.840
'How about to change your representative animal to a mosquito?'

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.580
Choerry: Buzzing

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.260
HaSeul: (Breaking News) I can't open the window for a a long time because there are too many mosquitoes!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.780
HaSeul: You know? Mosquitoes bit Kim Lip over 20 times!

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.460
HaSeul: The place for Choerry's MV shooting is far away from here! She has to go now!

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.680
HaSeul:  HOWEVER, we're gonna just stay here and rest until the shooting ends!!

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.300
HaSeul: Cheer up, Choerry!!!

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.340
Kim Lip: Cheer up, Choerry!

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.260
Choerry: I can do!

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.000
(Choery's representative animal is a fruit bat. So... she might be okay...)
