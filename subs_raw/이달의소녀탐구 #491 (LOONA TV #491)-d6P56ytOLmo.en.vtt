Yves and Go Won TV

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.260
What should we call it?

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.600
Y Go Moya~~

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.620
Huh!? I like that~~

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.200
Y(ves) Go(Won) Moya TV – the first episode

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.780
Is there any funny episode while we prepare our comeback?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.100
In my choreography,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.520
there is this scene where I step on Yves and Olivia Hye~

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.680
But Go Won was… actually…

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.760
just bad!

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.580
And by this time…. I thought she is now able to do the lift,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.280
but she kept making mistakes…

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.800
Or is trying to do it on purpose?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.420
Oh you knew that??

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.860
Yeah… I felt it

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.300
So if we do comeback, please pay attention to Go Won who is bugging me!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.560
How about we do selfie time?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.320
Y(ves) Go(Won) Moya TV is actually filled with a lot of contents

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.700
Oh~ man~ We have lots of good pictures~

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.040
Don’t forget to capture our images~

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.940
Ending!

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.020
Thank you for watching Y(ves) Go(Won) Moya TV!
