00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.400
(LOOΠΔ has arrived at the next set!)

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.640
JinSoul: Hello
Kim Lip: Hello

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.800
JinSoul: Actually, 4 members including us and ViVi left home early morning today

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.040
JinSoul: (Envnious) However, ViVi went to home already
Kim Lip: Yeah

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.520
Kim Lip: She’s bad…

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.100
JinSoul: So Lip and HeeJin should wait for me!

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.460
Kim Lip: Pardon?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.100
(Today’s last filming is JinSoul’s scene!)
JinSoul: Cause I’m the last~

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.340
JinSoul: Hey! Wait for me!
Kim Lip: Can’t hear you~

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.240
JinSoul: (Simple) Run and lip sync and it will end

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.440
Kim Lip: I guess that means it will take a long time. Am I wrong?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.280
JinSoul: Nah. It won’t take a long time~

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.660
JInSoul: Because you will sleep tight in the car then it will end~

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
Kim Lip: HeeJin is doing lip sync now

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.600
Kim Lip: I hope she will do her best~

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
Kim Lip: Then see you!
JinSoul: Fighting~

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.020
HeeJin: I slept really well in the car all the way to here

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.540
HeeJin: So I think my face is too puffy~

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.660
(Never…)

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.180
HeeJin: Does my face look puffy?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.660
HeeJin: Or is it not?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.160
HeeJin: (Ran out of things to say) See you~
