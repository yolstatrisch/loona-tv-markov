00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.500
YeoJin: Hello!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.700
YeoJin: I'm wearing this one-piece dress!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.680
YeoJin: Actually I'm feeling very ashamed!

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
YeoJin: I'm going to run with HaSeul holding her hand~

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.020
YeoJin: However I have a feeling that the weather will be hot!

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.340
HaSeul: Yes~

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.460
HaSeul: There are a lot of grass!

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.660
HaSeul: I think I could get a cut on the finger by these grass!

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.640
(Filming HaSeul &amp; YeoJin's scene has started with the big floor fan!)

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.900
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ - Hi High"

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.440
(They look very happy!)

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.140
(At the end of the way!)

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.620
(A manager is waiting for their safety!)

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.660
(YeoJin is lip syncing after the running scene is done)

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.680
(HaSeul mom is back!)

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.840
HaSeul: Yeah, today's filming is done~

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.000
HaSeul: You must be confused, right?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.060
(YeoJin answered by the facial expression)

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.280
HaSeul: Did you have fun?
YeoJin: Yeah, it was fun!

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.180
HaSeul: See you at the next set for music video!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.440
(You know that there are many episodes left, right?)
HaSeul &amp; YeoJin: Bye~
