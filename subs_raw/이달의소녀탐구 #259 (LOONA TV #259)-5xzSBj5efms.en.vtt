(Chuu filming the solo scene diligently)

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.200
#Now Playing “LOOΠΔ / Chuu - Heart Attack”

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.780
Yves: Do you know how many hours did I sleep last night?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.020
Yves: Just 1 hour~

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.820
Yves: I’m peeling a sweet potato for Chuu~

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.880
Yves: We have dance practice a lot at dawn before filming a music video.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.900
Yves: It seems like the fatigue is pilled up after that.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.700
Yves: Hey, eat it~

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.240
Yves: Because I peeled it all for you.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.800
(Chuu eating really well!)

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.640
Yves: Would you want some more?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.640
Yves: But eat slowly~

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.500
Chuu: Ah~ I’m so touched!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.480
Chuu: It feels like a gold!

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.420
Chuu: GOLD!

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.360
Yves: It was good, right?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.720
(Suddenly LOOΠΔ theatre of situations started!)
Chuu: Younggi’s mom got some pumpkin potatoes from the farm…

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.640
Yves: Mother~!

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.820
Yves: It’s pumpkin sweet potato, not pumpkin potato!

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.080
Chuu: Yes~ the pumpkin sweet potato~

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.040

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.180
Yves: Time to eat~
