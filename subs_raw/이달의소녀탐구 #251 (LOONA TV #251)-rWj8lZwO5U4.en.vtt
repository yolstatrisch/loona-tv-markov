(Chuu's outdoor photo shoot!)

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.980
(It looks warm on a screen...)

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.780
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ/Yves&amp;Chuu - Girl's Talk"

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.660
Chuu: Thank you~ It was really warm~!

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.980
(But actually it’s minus 7 degrees…)

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.160
Chuu: It’s fun. I'm not cold~

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.980
Chuu: Ah, really? Minus 7 degrees?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.520
Chuu: It didn’t seem like that at all!

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.820
ViVi: Ah, really~

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.040
ViVI: Really~? It didn’t seem like that~

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.320
JinSoul: I have a big red ribbon

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.700
Choerry: Hey~

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.100
Choerry: I’m Choerry!

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.960
(The girls hang out so well every shooting place!)

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.760
JinSoul: Suddenly you’re getting in the mood, right?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.320
Choerry: Just a concept~

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.520
JinSoul: Do you want to do a photo shoot today?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.580
Choerry: Absolutely~

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.100
Choerry: I’m dying to do it!

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.220
(So they decided to take pictures of each other...)

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.360
JinSoul: The ribbon is really big!
