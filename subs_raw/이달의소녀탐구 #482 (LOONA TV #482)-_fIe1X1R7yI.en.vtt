00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.200
(LOOΠΔ TV with the full group, it's been a while!)

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.020
(A girl with a bobbed hair who is standing beside HeeJin is HaSeul, as you know!)

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.500
HaSeul: Hello, I'm HaSeul and I cut my hair in a bob-type style!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.820
HaSeul: Unexpectedly, people told me that this hair style is very suitable for me

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.480
HaSeul: But ViVi told me not to laugh like a fool, under this hairstyle

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.180
HaSeul: So I'm trying to act in a chic way!

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.640
(As soon as she said it, she's showing her smile in a cute way!)

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.980
HaSeul: I mean, ViVi told me that I have to act in a chic way like the atmosphere of Iceland~

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.300
Kim Lip: HaSeul!

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.180
HaSeul: I'm in the middle of eating!

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.540
Kim Lip: Girls with Bob-type hair! It's called Bob hairs~
HaSeul: Oh, you also has a bob haircut?

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.000
Kim Lip: Yes, bob hairs
HaSeul: I didn't know~

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.400
(There's another member whose hair changed dramatically like HaSeul!)

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.260
Choerry: Look, I dyed my hair purple~

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.080
Choerry: My hair was brown, actually

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.700
Choerry: But this time, I changed it drastically into purple~

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.820
Choerry: I'm really want to see how it will show on the monitor!

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.020
Choerry: Then, see you in a few minutes~
