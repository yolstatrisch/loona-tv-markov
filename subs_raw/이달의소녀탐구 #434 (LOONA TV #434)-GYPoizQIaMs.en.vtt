00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.980

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.700

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.580
HaSeul: She seems happy nowadays

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.660
HaSeul: And I'm also happy~

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.820
HaSeul: (Suddenly?) You lost some weight, HyunJIn?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.660
(It makes HyunJin happy!)

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.020
HyunJin: I think I would cry~

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.017
HaSeul: I think so. I would cry a lot...
