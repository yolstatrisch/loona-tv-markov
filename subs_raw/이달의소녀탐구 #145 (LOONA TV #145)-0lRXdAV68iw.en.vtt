00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.300
Kim Lip: I'm scared

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.220

JinSoul: It's good

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.000
Kim Lip: Really?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.480
JinSoul: I'm so happy

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.040
JinSoul: Because now I'm doing my first photo shoot after releasing from blurring.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.880
JinSoul: But I have something to worry about.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.640

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.120
