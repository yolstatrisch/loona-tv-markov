00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.860
(A dog appeared in front of yyxy!)

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.620
Olivia Hye: Come on, come on...
Chuu: Come on, yo!

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.880
(a swimming dog!)

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.180
Go Won: The dog is really good at swimming~

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.740
Go Won: The dog followed the duck and was like 'whoa~~~'

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.040
Go Won: Then the duck was like 'Wow~~~'

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.860
Go Won: Any way, really good at swimming!

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.840
Chuu: Do you know what it is?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.500
Go Won: It was almost become our moves!

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.640
(Believe it or not...)

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.120
Go Won: Right, there was a move for 'considered a friend' part!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.760
Chuu: Considered a friend!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.200
(It's still a mystery whether it's true or not...)

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.400
(Anyway, the photo shooting in Budapest is over!)

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.540
Olivia Hye: It's done~
Yves: End!

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.740
Chuu: I was happy~

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.420
Chuu: even though there are so many flower petals

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.200
Chuu: You know, the weather is fine and I love it!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.920
Yves: y
Chuu: y
Go Won: x!

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.820
Olivia Hye: Then how should I do?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.200
Go Won: You're right. Let's do it again~
