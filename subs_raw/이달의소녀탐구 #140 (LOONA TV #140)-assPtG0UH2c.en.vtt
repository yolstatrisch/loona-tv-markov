HeeJin: For reals~ Her expressions

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.960

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.300
Kim Lip: But the song… has a fatal, captivating quality

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.480
(Cap-tivate!!!)

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.620

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.400

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.880
HaSeul: YeoJin~ Here you are…

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.460

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.320
