#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ/ODD EYE CIRCLE - Girl Front"

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.800
JinSoul: Do you know where we're going?
Kim Lip: We're not actually going to home

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.780
Kim Lip: We're going to watch the fireworks near Yeouido!

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.420
JinSoul: Right! It's the Seoul International Fireworks Festival!

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.440
Choerry: Fireworks Festival!

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.520
JinSoul: It will start at 7 pm but now 6:51

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.140
JinSoul: But here is Yeouido, right?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.340
Choerry: I think we'll be there right on the minute!
Kim Lip: Can we arrive at there in 9 minutes?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.120
JinSoul: But you should think about the seats.
Kim Lip: Look at that. There are a traffic jam...

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.780
JinSoul: We're wearing representative colored shirts.
Kim Lip: Red, blue, purple!

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.960
JinSoul: I'm blue~
Kim Lip: Red~

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.180
Choerry: Purple~

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.640
(Her English pronunciation has gotten better after trip to USA)

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.000
(Anyway, LOOΠ/ODD EYE CIRCLE is heading to watch the fireworks festival!)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.740
Kim Lip: We've arrived but the festival hasn't started yet.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.780
Choerry: So I'm relieved!

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.320
Choerry: Anyway, I really want to see it!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.480
JinSoul: It feels like... I'm relaxing...

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.180
JinSoul: And the wind blows gently.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.440
JinSoul: It feels like we are taking a rest

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.340
JinSoul: For the first time since the LA trip.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.160
(A sudden clap of thunder roared above them!)

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Kim Lip: Where? Where is it coming from?
Choerry: What was that noise?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.120
Kim Lip: It sounds like a gunfire...!

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.300
Choerry: They do like...

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.760
Choerry: Wararararara!!

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.800
(The fireworks festival has just started in the perfect timing!)

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.140
(And LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE has just arrived at the perfect place to watch!)

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.880
Kim Lip: Where is it coming from?
JinSoul: There! Over there!

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.500
JinSoul: Make a wish!

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.140
(Aren't you curious about what they each wished upon the fireworks?)

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.640
JinSoul: I think the shape of the fireworks is really unique.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.760
Choerry: Seeing that makes me craving doughnuts!!

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.700
(Those fireworks look like a doughnut...)

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.940
Choerry: It's very dramatic because...

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.900
JinSoul: In the car, we hoped the festival would start after we arrived at the site...

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.280
JinSoul: It became real! It's amazing!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.420
Choerry: Hey mom, are you watching it? I'm watching it like this.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.040
Kim Lip: It's so cool!

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.300
(The blurred girl is surprised as well!)

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.900
JinSoul: It's really beautiful and fancy more than I thought!

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.400
Kim Lip: And they moved and mixed themselves in the air

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.140
Choerry: The color that I like, the pink fireworks are soaring!

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.460
JinSoul: Like the colored fireworks, we each have representative colors.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.180
I hope someday we could shine like the fireworks over there!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120
JinSoul: Oh, it sounds like a wise saying.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.320
Choerry: Oh~~
JinSoul: Yeah, the wise saying.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040
JinSoul: Like the fireworks shine,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.780
I hope all 12 members including LOOΠΔ 1/3,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.760
ODD EYE CIRCLE, YeoJin, and the unreleased four girls could shine in the future!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.980
Kim Lip: All 12 members!

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.700
JinSoul: Twinkle, twinkle!
Choerry: Twinkle, twinkle!

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.380
JinSoul: I hope we could twinkle like those!

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.700
Kim Lip: We're gonna do our best until the day!

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.600
OEC: 1,2, 3, fighting!
