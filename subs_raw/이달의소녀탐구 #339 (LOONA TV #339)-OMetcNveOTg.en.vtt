(They’re having a short sightseeing in a Prague airport…)

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.640
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ / yyxy - frozen"

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.640
(And the time passes by fast…)

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.160
Olivia Hye: We’re on the bus heading to the airplane!

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.420
Chuu: Airplane!

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.120
Chuu: We have to take the flight about 13 hours…

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.140
Yves: (3-syllable poem) 프(p)!
Chuu: 프라이(fry!!

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.560
Yves: 라 (La)!
Chuu: Lamen!

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.100
Yves: 하 (ha!)
Chuu: Hahaha..

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.440
Yves: Ha, i’m gonna eat all day!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.600
Chuu: Ha Soo-Young~
Go Won: Ha Soo-Young ate up all!
(*Ha Soo-Young is Yves' real name)

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.200
Yves: It’s been awhile since I heard my name, ‘Ha Soo-Young’

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.940
Yves: I feel like tearing up….

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.860
Yves: It’s cold!

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.080
Go Won: They keep telling me that I have to be standing in the plane!

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.000
Go Won: I know it’s not, right?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.200
Yves: No, you’re wrong. ‘F’ means standing!

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.940
(They’re trying to capture this moment by taking a photo!)

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.140
Chuu: Please take a picture of me!

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.500
Yves: (Respect) I think not just anyone can be an Instagram star, right?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100
(This sky view is beautiful enough to post on Instagram!)

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.200
(And finally they arrived at Budapest!)

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.920
(What will happen here!)
