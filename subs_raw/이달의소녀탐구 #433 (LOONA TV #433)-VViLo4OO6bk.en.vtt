00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.120
(JinSoul &amp; Olivia Hye are very curious about how the stage looks like)
JinSoul: Shall we go to see the stage?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.020
JinSoul: I'm nervous because I think the stage would be so big

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.240
JinSoul: Because the waiting room is bigger than I expected!

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.760
Olivia Hye: Where is the stage, then?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.700
(The members on their way to stage)

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.880
(As expected, the large scale stage!)

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.520
Choerry: This is...

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.180
Choerry: the stage we will perform~

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.380
Choerry: Oh my...
Kim Lip: Oh my gosh~

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.500

(The members saying hello to the staffs with courtsey!)

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.240
JinSoul: Wow~

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.860
Kim Lip: I guess they can't here us~

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.680
Choerry: It's super cool

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.460
Kim Lip: And the very loud sound!

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.720
(Accidentally, The three members of ODD EYE CIRCLE are here!)

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.220
Kim Lip: It seems like it's been a long time since we three stood like this~

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.060
Kim Lip: But I think you can't here...!

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.840
Kim Lip: Well... now you can here me....

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.260
(Such a perfect timing!)

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.820
Kim Lip: Anyway, all the members of ODD EYE CIRCLE stand here together for a long time~

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.460
JinSoul: The seats are very close to the stage

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.660
JinSoul: And I didn't expect it!

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.060
(LOOΠΔ members are so excited to meet the fans, Orbit!)
JinSoul: We will do like this!

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.017
(LOOΠΔ members are so excited to meet the fans, Orbit!)
