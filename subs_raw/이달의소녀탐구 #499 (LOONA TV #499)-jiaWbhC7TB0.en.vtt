00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.500
So whoever loses, has to clean up all the stuff that we ate!

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Choerry and YeoJin were the last two remained!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.120
The final competition that decides who is going to clean the mess!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.680
Tang!

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.320
Tang…

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.080
Choerry is the one!!!

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.740
Thanks for the meal~~

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.400
Oh man~~

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.340
LMAO~~

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.880
Oh man I just wanted to beat YeoJin~

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.960
While cleaning the mess, Choerry dropped the chopsticks

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.420
Don’t you dare to help her!!

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.700
Helping is NO NO NO~

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
Then do whatever you guys need to do~~

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.720
Why is everyone examining of what I’m doing??

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.680
My job is to examining you!

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.100
Hey Choerry! It’s raining and cold outside ~~

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.320
After the cleanup, Choerry is practicing a game with JinSoul

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.820
Tang

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.440
Soo

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.380
Choerry lost again…

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.000
She is so bad at this game!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.320
I can’t do this anymore~~

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.880
And now Choerry is practicing the same game with Kim Lip!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.200
But fails as soon as the game starts…

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.800
She is wrong! She has to buy me a black bean sauce noodle!

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.400
Tries the game again with other name  
(Tang Soo Yook = Sweet and Sour Pork)

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.080
Lost again…

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.020
Got myself a sweet and sour pork~~

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.940
Yeee~~ About to eat that black bean sauce noodle and sweet and sour pork for myself~

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.020
Kim Lip (the leader) is giving all the love to Choerry…
