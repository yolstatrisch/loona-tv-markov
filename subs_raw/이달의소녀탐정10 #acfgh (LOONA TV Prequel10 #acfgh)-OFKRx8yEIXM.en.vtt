00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.460
(Does everyone remember this scene?)

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.420
'Can you wear those clothes perfectly?'

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.620
HeeJin: You know?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.460
HeeJin: You know? I'm a master of concept.
(It means she can do any kinds of concept)

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.640
HaSeul: Oh~ REALLY~~

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.240
(Anyway, the girls are filming diligently!)

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.220
Choerry: The white part of my eyes are little bigger than others.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.940
(She has perfect eyes for the girl crush concept!)

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.560
HeeJin: I think you need to move your head more when you do a photo shoot.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.780
(HeeJin, the master of concept, gives good advice to Choerry)
HeeJin: You were just looking straight at the camera...

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.080
(After hearing advice from HeeJin, Choerry is doing a photo shoot with LipSoul)

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.680
'Choerry is doing a lot of photo shoot today, right?'
