00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.800
(ViVi is back to LOOΠΔ 1/3’s android ViVi)

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.100
ViVi: I have to run soon

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.620
ViVI: So I have to prepare it

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.840
ViVi: Even though I’m not good at running…

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.360
ViVi: I was running a little faster last time

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.000
ViVi: However I’m poor at running for a long time

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.720
ViVi: I’m really bad at it

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420
ViVi: Just for a short time?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.700
ViVi: Maybe...

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.280
ViVi: A minute?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.260
ViVi: About 1 minute?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.760
(She’s trying her best to run like an android, although she’s not the type of a long-distance runner)

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.160
ViVi: There’s no sun in the sky, however it’s hotter than I expected

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.880
ViVi: You can’t see it, but it’s hot

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.480
ViVi: So my bangs are stuck to my face

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740
ViVi: I had bangs before I started running

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.140
ViVi: However when I started running, they were gone.
