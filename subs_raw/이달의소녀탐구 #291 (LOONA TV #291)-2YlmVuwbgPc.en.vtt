HaSeul: This is a wand!

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.680
HaSeul: That I bought from nearby D*ISO

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.520
HaSeul: And It makes sound!

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.540
(Ringing)

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.580
HaSeul: I'm gonna lead our members with using this wand a little bit later.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.960
HaSeul: I declare that this is a new wand for the leader.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.920
HaSeul: And you can see the star here.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.720
HaSeul: We are LOOΠΔ and it means the moon, right?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.720
HaSeul: (HaSeul's official comment) So this star represents our fans.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.880
HaSeul: I worry that I'll be the only one appearing on this LOOΠΔ TV episode!

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.660
HaSeul: Hi, Kim Lip!

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.260
HaSeul: When does your filming start?
Kim Lip: What is this? You surprised me!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.760
HaSeul: What does this cross mean?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.160
HaSeul: What does this pocket mean?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.240
HaSeul: And why are your pants so tight?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.980
HaSeul: Hi, ViVi~

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.540
HaSeul: Why are you wearing a necklace?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.660
ViVi: Well... I'm...

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.960
ViVi: It's just a concept...

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.500
HaSeul: There are a lot of people here.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.040
HaSeul: One, two, three, four...

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.520
(Too many people, too much noise)

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.220
HaSeul: I guess there are 20 poeple including staffs here!

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.060
Go Won: Hello!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.380
Go Won: There are too many people here!

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.320
Go Won: And you talk too much!

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.860
HaSeul: Because~

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.520
HaSeul: BECAUSE~

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.540
HaSeul: Talking too much makes loud sound and these elements make LOOΠΔ TV interesting!
Go Won: Oh really? However, it's too noisy~

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.100
HeeJin: I heard that too many voices on audio are not appropriate to be aired.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.320
HaSeul: Shall we try to filming against a mirror?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.020
HaSeul: If you take it in front of a mirror, you can get more beautiful picture!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.560
