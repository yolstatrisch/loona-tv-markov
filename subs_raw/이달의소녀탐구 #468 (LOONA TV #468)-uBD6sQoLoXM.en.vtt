00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.980
(The morning of the Iceland teaser shooting day!)

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.440
Olivia Hye: It's already cold~

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.880
(She looking the other way...)

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.040
Go Won: Uh....

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.920
Go Won: I'm worried that it'll be a bit cold~

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.620
(This place looks much colder with this BGM...)

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.320
Olivia Hye: But...

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.040
Olivia Hye: It's not as cold as I thought it would be...

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.900
Go Won: (What?)

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.280
Olivia Hye: Actually, I don't know
Go Won: Because she's not going to do shooting today...

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.880
(Only Go Won is scheduled to do shooting today)

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.000
Olivia Hye: What if it rains?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
(She seems to hope it rains....)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.040
(Anyway, the teaser shooting is started with Go Won's professional posture!)

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.200
(Olivia Hye is enjoying her freedom with Go Won in the back!)

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.240
Olivia Hye: Who is she bowing low to...?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.460
Olivia Hye: Why does she lying down desperately...?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.340
Olivia Hye: Is she frozen there?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.240
Olivia Hye: Is she okay...?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.560
Olivia Hye: And... now I can't move my mouth...

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.520
Olivia Hye: It's colder than I thought...

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.420
Olivia Hye: I think I'm feeling the cold more than you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.020
Go Won: Her nose turned red~

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.017
Olivia Hye: My nose is about to run...
