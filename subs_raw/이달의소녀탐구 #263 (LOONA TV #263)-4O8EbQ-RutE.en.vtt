Kim  Lip: We have to dance like this, right?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.040
(But HaSeul's eyes are almost closed!)

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.100
HaSeul: Before I came here, I stayed up all night.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.460
HaSeul: And... you know, I just wanted to look pretty

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.060
HaSeul: Becuase it's been a long time for me to shoot a music video.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.640
HaSeul: But I heard my turn will be started at 9 pm.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.840
HaSeul: So I believe it would be better to sleep little more before.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.740
HaSeul: But it's okay.
Kim Lip: You're wrong!

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.480
HaSeul: I'm not wrong!
Kim Lip: Your face would be puffy, if you slept.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.900

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.660
HaSeul: I walk slowly like this...

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.220
HaSeul: Suddenly I find Chuu like' Oh, it's Chuu~'

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.540
HaSeul: I wake her up smoothly

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.820
HaSeul: When Chuu gets up...

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340
HaSeul: Then I go on my way again!

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.860
