JinSoul: Do you want to know who is Olivia Hye's alter ego?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.640
(As you now, it's HeeJin!)

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.220
HeeJin: The fans watching the music video will know it's me?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.740
HeeJin: I bet they will never guess who this is.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.740
JinSoul: They're lying on like that.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.360
JinSoul: Oh~ Awesome!

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.580
JinSoul: Wow~

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.700
JinSoul: Beautiful~

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.160
HeeJin: Hey~

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.420
JinSoul: Fighting!

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.700
(And here is the set for 3rd day of music video shootign!)

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.720
HeeJin: And...

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.520
HeeJin: I'm feeling like a reporter!

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.120
HeeJin: LOOΠΔ's first member HeeJin and Olivia Hye are going to meet each other

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.480
on this rooftop!

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.320
HeeJin: It's the last day of music video shooting!

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.920
HeeJin: Cheer up, Olivia Hye!

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.580
HeeJin: Our members~

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.880
HeeJin: Ogenki desu ka?
(Ogenki desu ka is japanese and means 'How are you?' in English)

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.160
(However, a strong wind on the rooftop makes it difficult to say 'I'm okay')

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.520
(Nevertheless, the two girls are trying their best!)

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.960
