00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.020
(But the situation looks serious... What happened to her?)

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.540
HaSeul: Why didn't you do like this?

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.020

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220
YeoJin: But I didn't. So I'm disappointed ..

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.940
HaSeul: There is one more shooting left, right?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.240
HaSeul: So you have one more chance, right?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.180
HaSeul: Okay, don't be disappointed!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.180
HaSeul: Say 'fighitng' to the camera~

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.860
(Older members taking care of YeoJin!)
HaSeul &amp; Yves: 1, 2, 3, fighting~

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.640
YeoJin: I tried to do better...

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.740
YeoJin: However, I disappointed that it didn't work out the way I wanted...

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460
YeoJin: I'll do better next time~

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.220
(And YeoJin seems to feel better so quickly!)

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.520
(And YeoJin seems to feel better so quickly!)
YeoJin: Me~

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.140
(And YeoJin seems to feel better so quickly!)
