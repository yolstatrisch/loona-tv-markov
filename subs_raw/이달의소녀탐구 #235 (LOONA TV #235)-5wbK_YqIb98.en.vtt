(Yves who warms herself up in a small room beside the shooting site)
'Cold medicine'

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.000
(Yves who warms herself up in a small room beside the shooting site)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.800
(It’s her first MV shooting but it’s too cold… What is she thinking about now?)

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.600
Yves: I have no thoughts.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.140
(She is taking a sip of cold medicine without thinking)

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.480
(And sipping again)

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.000
Yves: Shall we go (to shoot again)?
'Okay.'

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.180
'You have to drink it all when you come back!'
Yves: Yep!

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.000
(Yves is walking out bravely although the weather is extreme cold!)

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.500
