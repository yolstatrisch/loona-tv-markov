00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.680
(Two members watching O.E.C and Olivia Hye's filming!)

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.780
Chuu: ODD EYE CIRCLE is...

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.420
Chuu: staring at Olivia Hye!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.120
Chuu: Oh my... my Olivia Hye... come over here~
HeeJin: No~

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.740
(HeeJin and Chuu are hugging each other and two girls are coming behind them withouth making a noise!)

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.080
(HeeJin and Chuu are hugging each other and two girls are coming behind them withouth making a noise!)
Chuu: I want to shoot something with HeeJin like that...

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.780
(HeeJin and Chuu are hugging each other and two girls are coming behind them withouth making a noise!)
HeeJin: So do I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.900
HeeJin: Uh? What?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.520
(Two girls are Yves and Go Won!)

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.420
HeeJin: (Join yyxy!) From now on, I'm Olivia HeeJin!

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.260
Chuu: Olivia Hee~!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.780
Yves: It's too long, right?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.160
(Olivia + Yves = Oli Yves~)

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.680
(Olivia + Go Won = Oligo)

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.800
Chuu: Oligo-dang (Oligosaccharide) ~~

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.560
(As expected, LOOΠΔ / yyxy is funny like a comedian...)

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.560
(And the shooting is still continuing)

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.220
Chuu: Are they threatening our Olivia Hye...?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.560
Yves: Nope, that's not good!

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.520
Yves: Don't threat people like that~

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.460
Chuu: That's what I'm saying!

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.020
Chuu: Hey!

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.640
Chuu: You...

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.440
Chuu: Better realize that approaching like that could be a threat to someone!

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.540
(They're threatening them to not threat Olivia Hye...)

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.100
Yves: How about showing 'the gesture' later today?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.660
(Chuu sensed what she is thinking)

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.340
Go Won: You mean this?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.300
(Yves is the trend icon of LOOΠΔ!)

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.540
(Doing this gesture is good when you love this feeling)

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.560
(Please look forward to LOONA's swag as a whole group!)
