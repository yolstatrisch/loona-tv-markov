00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.960
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ / HeeJin - ViViD"
(HeeJin, the founder of LOOΠΔ, is left alone at the set!)

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.980
HeeJin: Hey~

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.380
HeeJin: The members went to our company's building for a while~

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.500
HeeJin: after shooting group dance scene was done~

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.440
HeeJin: However! I have to film my individual scene~

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.460
HeeJin: The scene is..

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340
HeeJin: (Bright) Jumping off the rooftop!

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.600
HeeJin: I don't know exactly how I should do~!

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.040
HeeJin: Anyway, see you soon on the rooftop! Bye!

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.560
(Aren't you curious how this scene was filmed?)

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.500
(Like Olivia Hye's jump scene, a stunt person jumped instead of HeeJin!)

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.340
HeeJin: Oh...

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
HeeJin: Although a lot of safety equipments were set up there, I think it doesn't mean that it's not dangerous.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080
HeeJin: Despite all that, she's trying really hard...

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.140
HeeJin: I greatly appreciate about that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.460
HeeJin: Thanks to her efforts

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040
HeeJin: This scene will be greater and more beautiful than any other scenes in the music video

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.440
HeeJin: Of course, I will do my best too!

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.540
HeeJin: To connect her scene and my scene naturally!

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.460
HeeJin: And to successfully pretend that this scene is filmed by me!
