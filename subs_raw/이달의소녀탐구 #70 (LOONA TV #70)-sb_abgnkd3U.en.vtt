HyunJin matches really well with the fine weather of Taiwan!
'The weather is very nice!'

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.240
'Umm~ the wind~!'

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.400
'You know? I’m good at impersonating voices.'

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.640
'Patrick Star! (from SpongeBob SquarePants)'

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.060
'I love~ you~'

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.220
'SpongeBob! (from SpongeBob SquarePants)'

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.200
'Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha'

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.100
'Hima Nohara! (form Crayon Shin-chan)'

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.540
Suddenly she’s embarrased…

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.440
'I feel like crawling into a hole somewhere!'

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.500
'HaSeul!'

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.100
'SEAL~~'

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.900
Is she imitating HaSeul of this scene…??

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560
'I saw HyunJin’s vocal mimicry of someone…'

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.200
'I’m going to impersonate HaSeul, too!'

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.780
'SEAL~~'

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.020
'But right next to her, HaSeul is watching HeeJin’s impersonating!!'

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.280
'SEAL~~'

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.900
'It’s same~'

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.020
'Nope~!'

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.620
'HaSeul, please move your lips like ‘SEAL~' when I count to 3!'

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.620
'1, 2, 3'

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.180
'SEAL~~'
