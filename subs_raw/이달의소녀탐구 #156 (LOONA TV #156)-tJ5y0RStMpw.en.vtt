00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.660
(Lip PD will cover for HaSeul PD today)

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.240
So, please watch how good I am at shooting video all day today.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.220
You better watch out, HaSeul PD!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.080
I will work hard and catch up with you!

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080
(But before that... You better hold the camera correctly)

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.740
This is the set for JinSoul's music video

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.860
I suppose you must be curious what is she doing now, right?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.860
I'll show you!

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.140
(Just curious about how long she will shoot video upside down...)

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.060
(Finally she hold the camera correctly!)
Finally I come here to interview a today's main star, JinSoul!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.780
Hey, JinSoul. How are you feeling?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.960
Kim Lip: How is it going now? 
JinSoul: It's hot

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.880
JinSoul: It's so hot

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.780
Kim LIp: I've heard you're having trouble in dancing with your heels.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.780
Kim Lip: Is it okay?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.140
JinSoul: Yeah, okay. I'm fine.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.420
Kim Lip: See you~

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.020
Kim Lip: Say hello to the camera!

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.400
Kim Lip: Hey JinSoul! Say hello to the camera!!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.980
'(She's working hard) Hey! JungEun!!!'

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.980
(Kim Lip is still inexperience in filming)
Kim Lip: Jin... Soul...

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.960
(Kim Lip is still inexperience in filming)
'Lip, Kim Lip!'
