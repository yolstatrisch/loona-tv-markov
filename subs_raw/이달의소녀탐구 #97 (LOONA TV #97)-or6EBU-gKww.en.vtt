It's a hallway which is full of swag!

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.780
*FREEZE*

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.920
HyunJin : (A girl rapper) HaSeul, let's do a rap battle!

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.820
HyunJin : I don't know your identity, if you're a girl or a boy~

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.580
HyunJin : It's the same~

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.880

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480
HyunJin : It's the same! (Punchilnes!)

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.180
HyunJin must have seen it from somewhere...

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.940
HaSeul : You run out of the car, after smashing the front door

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.040
Now HaSeul is singing Dynamic Duo's "Guilty"

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.420
Suddenly she's so embarrassed...

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.120
HyunJin : Do you want to build a snowman~

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.100
