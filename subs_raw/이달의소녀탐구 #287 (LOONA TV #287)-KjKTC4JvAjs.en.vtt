00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.700
HeeJin: I'm on my way to shoot my part of the teaser video.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.160
HeeJin: Wow, I'm the only one to film at the outside.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.340
(HeeKki's fateful meeting with GeomKki!)

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.820

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.980
(However, the rabbit looks uncomfortable...)

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.160
HeeJin: The rabbit was squirming restlessly in my arms...

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.460
HeeJin: Maybe he felt nervous or something...

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.720
HeeJin: So I had to take care of him...

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.080
HeeJin: While I was trying to act in front of the camera...

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.560
HeeJin: And even I had to care about my hair!

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.300
HeeJin: It should come out very well...

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.480
HeeJin: So I'm nervous..

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.460
HeeJin: Hey, rabbit. Please help me a little~

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.860
HeeJin: Don't worry, I'll finish soon!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.280
(The second attempt to shoot with the rabbit!)

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.780
(The rabbit looks more comfortable than the first time)

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.500
HeeJin: I think he's getting relived.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.160
HeeJin: I hope it will come out pretty~

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.780
HeeJin: as much as we tried...

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920
HeeJin: Thank you for helping me, rabbit~
