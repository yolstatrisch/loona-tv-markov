00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.240
'I'm going to give you a pizza'

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.900
'But there's one conditon'

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.320
'Only one person can eat pizza'

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.200
(The rule is that only the winner of rock-paper-scissors can eat pizza!)
LOOΠΔ : Rock, paper, scissors

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.460
LOOΠΔ : Rock, paper, scissors

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.600
(The winner is HaSeul!)

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
'HaSeul, will you eat alone?'

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.100
HeeJin : Don't mind me. You can eat alone.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.640
(But there was a secret rule!)

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.680
'The winner of rock-paper-scissors can eat alone'

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.400
'If the winner wants to finish the game'

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.300
'But If she decides to play rock-paper-scissors with the director,'

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.580
'She will have two choices'

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.840
'If she wins, you all will eat pizza. But if she loses to director, there will be nothing'

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.040
HaSeul : HeeJin, do you want to eat?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.460
(She's praying...)

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.660
HaSeul : Do you want to eat?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.220
HaSeul : I want to eat pizza with our members!

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.040
(Yeah, she's such a true leader!)

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.020
HaSeul : My earrings fell out!

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.720
(Another curse of HaSeul??)

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.280
'You can win, HaSeul!'

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.780
HyunJin : Rock paper scissors!

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.340
(What's the result?)
