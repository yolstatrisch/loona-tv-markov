Chuu: Ah, I think so

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.680

(The food might be not good enough for Chuu)
Yves: 1.5? Serious?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.780
(It looks delicious, right?)

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.420
(Yves' estimation?)

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.840
Chuu It's a fail!

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.780
(They're filming in the hotel even though the tesaer shooting was over!)
Yves: We've arrived at the hotel

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.840
(They're filming in the hotel even though the tesaer shooting was over!)
Chuu: The shooting was over and we came here

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.580
Yves: Anyway, we came here, the hotel

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.000
Yves: So we're going to wash up and get some sleep~

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.580
Chuu: Let them watch we're sleeping

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.760
(What schedules left before they go back to Korea?)
Yves: See you~

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.900
(What schedules left before they go back to Korea?)
Chuu: We're sleeping!

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.740
Chuu: FOOD!

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.480
(It's almost like LOOΠΔ FOOD TV, not LOOΠΔ TV)
Chuu: We're here to eat!

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.160
Yves: We came here on the first day in Hong Kong, actually

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.040
Yves: We realized later that this restaurant is very famous

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.680
Chuu: I couldn't stop thinking here even when I eat a meal in another restaurant. Now I know the reason

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.580
(Dumpling-flavored dumpling!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.860
Yves: Oh, thumbs up?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.920
Yves: I couldn't see your thumb during last two days~

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.780
(Anyway, LOOΠΔ full group's LOOΠΔ TV is coming soon!)
Yves: I didn't see your thumb all day yesterday!

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.018
(Anyway, LOOΠΔ full group's LOOΠΔ TV is coming soon!)
Chuu: Thumbs, in two days!
