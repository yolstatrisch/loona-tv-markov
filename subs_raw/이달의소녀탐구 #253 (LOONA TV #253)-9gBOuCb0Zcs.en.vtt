00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.580
JinSoul: It's very pretty!

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.620

Yves: What? Grandfather's?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.740
(Anyway, MV for The Carol 2.0 was shot at the same time with Chuu's photo shooting.)
ViVi: Because it's all red. That's why...

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.580
JinSoul: You know, actually I came here as just a gift...

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.980
JinSoul: Gifts can't be excluded from Christmas~
Choerry: Absoultely yes!

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.000
('Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh baby~')

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.780
(Suddenly The Carol 2.0 is playing!)

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.840
Choerry: Such a good timing!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.740
(The MV shoot has started!)

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.420

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.880
JinSoul: There are hidden assistants!

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.420
JinSoul: Let me introduce ViVi's role!

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.920
ViVi: 'Christmas melodies heard around~'

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.180
JinSoul: She is telling Choerry a part and lyrics!

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.260
ViVi: 'I get reminded when I’m with you'

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.440
(It's really helpful to her!)

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.720
(Choerry who helps Yves!)
Choerry: 'And the white snow I’ve been waiting'

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.180

Choerry: It feels like I’m reliving it

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.120
Choerry: The MV shoting has ended successfully!
