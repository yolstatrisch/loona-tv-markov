00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.340
(While Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry working hard,)

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.380
(HaSeul &amp; YeoJin are resting on a sofa.)

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.940
YeoJin: Hi guys, welcome to my radio show.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.840
YeoJin: Well, what are you doing now?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.640
YeoJin: It’s 4:30

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.580
YeoJin: This is the most sentimental time of the day.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.860
YeoJin: Let’s listen to the first song.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.300
YeoJin: 'My Melody' by HaSeul &amp; YeoJin

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.020
(Only HaSeul seems unperturbed by this situation….)

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.960
YeoJin: Ggomul Ggomul Ggoomul
(*Ggomul and Ggoomul means Wriggle in Korean)

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.500
(HaSeul singing ‘My Melody’, as YeoJin wished.)

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.420
'Why don’t you sing the song?'

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.520
(Although she didn’t sing, but she seems to know how to lip-sync perfectly!)
