HyunJIn: Hey, get out, Park Gowon!

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.940
Go Won: Ah~ Why~

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.820
Go Won: I think these two look alike and we two look alike

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.040
Olivia Hye: We all look alike, don’t it?
Yves: Is that so?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.140
Go Won: We’re not that close

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.240
Go Won: Then how we can take a natural selfie?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.580
(The combination of the second girl from the front and the second girl from the end!)

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.740
(Anyway they’ve started “Sse sse sse”)

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.960
Go Won: Yves~

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.040

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.460
HyunJin: Let’s do the friendship test!
Go Won: (Annoyed) Ah…

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.000
HyunJin: Let’s show them how good our friendship is!

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.300
HyunJin &amp; Go Won: The friendship test!

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.660
HyunJin: We’re so not in sync!

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.000
HyunJin: Did you see? We’re close~

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.660
Go Won: No! We’re not close!

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.120
(Olivia Hye was watching it all and shook her head)

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.400
‘Why are you laughing?’

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000
Olivia Hye: Because they look like they’re too much close~

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.420
HyunJin: Let’s stop now, I’m so tired.
Go Won: What?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.440
YeoJin: Hey! Son Hyejoo!
HyunJin: Park Chaewon!

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.580
(Two events happened simultaneously)

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.040
(Sorry! We have just only one camera!)
