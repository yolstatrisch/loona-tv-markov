Go Won: My hair is getting messy because of HeeJin!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.780
Go Won: Sit down!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.880
(HeeJin just pretending to sit down!)

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.140
Go Won: Hey, you!

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.180
Go Won: Get lower!

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.420
(There is a resemblance between them)
HeeJin: Do we look alike?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.680
Go Won: But look, Kim Lip seems to not agree with us~

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.120
Kim Lip: Look alike? Serious?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.520
Kim Lip: Oh, right. Their teeth look alike~

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.940
HeeJin: Because we born in 2000~
Go Won: Yeah

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.600
Kim LIp: You guys really don't put me in?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.200
Go Won: You had to born 2000, not 1999!

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.080
HeeJin: Right, you had to born just one year later~

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.780
(Here comes the girls who born 2001)

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.500
Choerry: We can do it well today, right?
Olivia Hye: Sure~

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.020
Olivia Hye: And Choerry will sing my song 'Rosy'

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.740
Olivia Hye: with other members of ODD EYE CIRCLE

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.040
Choery: Right. I will sing that instead of you~

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.180
Olivia Hye: Okay...

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.100
HaSeul: It's a blur party!

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.540
(It took hours to blur people because of the mirrors all around)
HaSeul: There are a lot of blurred people!

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.100
HaSeul: I heard someone call me

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.840
(Someone calling HaSeul!)

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.260
YeoJin: Please help me to do it!

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.360
HaSeul: Did you come a long way because of just this? Really?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.140
(Anyway, all the members are doing their best to prepare the rehearsal!)
Chuu: Hello~

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.017
(Anyway, all the members are doing their best to prepare the rehearsal!)
