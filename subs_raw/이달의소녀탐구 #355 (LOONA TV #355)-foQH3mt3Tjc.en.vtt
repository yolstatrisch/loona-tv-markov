00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.220
The last day morning in Budapest!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.700
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ / yyxy - frozen"

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.640
(And LOOΠΔ / yyxy are not fully awake yet even they're in front of the camera!)

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.220
Olivia Hye: Ah, I slept a lot~

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.380
Chuu: Me too...

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.260
Olivia Hye: Way too much...
Yves: I'm swollen...

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.780
Yves: It's a bittersweet moment right now...

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.180
Yves: When I go back to Korea

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.520
Yves:  I will hand something delicious out to our members and hug them firstly

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.140
Yves: And I will eat cooked rice.
Go Won: Me too! I want to eat that too!

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.600
Yves: Also I want to eat kimchi!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.360
(They really want to eat Korean food. Because they stayed in Hungary for a long time!)

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.500
Olivia Hye: I don't know when I can come back to Hungary.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.100
Olivia Hye: I feel a sense of satisfaction for having great time here.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.200
Olivia Hye: And I will go back to Korea quickly.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.980
(Olivia Hye's perfect comment for the ending!)

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.980
Yves: Such a smooth talker!

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.320
Go Won: Bye bye Hungary~

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.100
(They're saying goodbye to Budapest!)

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.420
