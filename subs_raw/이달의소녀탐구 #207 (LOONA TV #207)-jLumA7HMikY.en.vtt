(Next shooting spot is a car elevator)

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.720
(The girls are a little frightened...)

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.560
'Don't worry, it's fine'

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.360
(It looks little dangerous but it's really safe place for photo shooting)

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.160

'It's safe!'

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.020
(But somehow Kim Lip is laughing... )

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.580
'Kim Lip, why are you laughing~'

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.500
'Bye~'
Choerry: See you, everyone~

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.480
Kim Lip: But... I'm wondering what will happen if the door close.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.400
Kim Lip: Just stay here? that's all?
Choerry: (Queen of positivity) Going down is just going down~

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.460
Choerry, Kim Lip: Bye~

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.060
(The photo shooting is continuing!)

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.760
(But a staff is pressing the button to hold the door!)

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.880
(But suddenly the alert sounds coming from the elevator!)

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.380
(!!!)

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720
Choerry: Bye~

(What a move, Kim Lip!)

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.600
JinSoul: What are you doing! you said we all are going down together~

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.960
(Kim Lip coming under fire for her briliant move...)

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.260
(Kim Lip coming under fire for her brilliant move...)
'Ah~ why don't you know that it's a prank cam for you?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.920
Kim Lip: Someone who is supposed to live, has to live anyway~

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100
(She saying whatever... Probably she's really embarrased...)

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.839
(She turned red all over because of embarrassing!)
'You turned red!'
