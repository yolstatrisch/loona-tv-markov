(LOOΠΔ 1/3 has arrived at near the river)

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.100
HaSeul : I'm scared...

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.760
HaSeul : What shoud I do...?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.060
ViVi : No scary thought, no scary whatever you see

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.100
(There are a lot of birds around the river!)

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.640
ViVi : (They’re) Eating bread!

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.560
(ViVi &amp; HyunJin are excited about hanging out with the birds)

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.040
HyunJin : Maybe HaSeul would be very scared of it...

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.360
HeeJin : We were doing a group photo shoot

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.540
HaSeul : But when I was getting close to the birds

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.880
HaSeul : I was like.. shaking so hard..

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.720
HaSeul : So the director told me to get in the bus and take a rest

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.440
HaSeul : I think if we actually went there, we would almost pass out

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.860
HeeJin : Yes. We would really pass out.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.100
(When will they get along with the birds?)
