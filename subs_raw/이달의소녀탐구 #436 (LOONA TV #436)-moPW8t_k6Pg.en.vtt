00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.980
Yves: We will try our best

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.200
Yves: to remind you of this part when you listen 'Hi High'

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.000
Yves: so  you have to get smaller

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.220
Yves: And I have to get bigger!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.400
YeoJin: Right, until I become 1 meter and you become 5 meter
Yves: Yeah

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Yves: Then we will be like this in the camera!

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.400
(Yves &amp; YeoJin trying their best to make LOOΠΔ TV more fun!)

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.540
Yves: So let's try our best for it!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.940
Yves: And why don't we make up the name for us?
YeoJin: Well...

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.980
