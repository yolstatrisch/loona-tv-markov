00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
(LOOΠΔ TV in Hong Kong starts with a sound like a dog)
Yves: Aw.... you got a cold?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.640
(This sound is too strong to be aired, so it's blurred)
Yves: My ears!

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.520
Yves: We're going to Hungary...
Chuu: What?

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.220
Yves: I mean, Hungary is not today's destination, we're going to Hong Kong!
Chuu: She's not awake yet!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.220
(They moved to a lounge in the airport to have some time to rest)
Yves&amp;Chuu: Lounge!

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.120
Chuu: We just ate food here, a lounge and then~

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.080
(And she doesn't know the next schedule)

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.640
Chuu: Okay~

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.160
(Nothing to say...)

Yves: Chuu, where do you want to go if you can travel?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.120
Chuu: Italy~ and Hawaii~

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.040
Chuu: And! that... salt beach... sea?
Yves: (Simple joke) Do you like salt?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.100
Chuu: (Disappointed) No....

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.440
Chuu: Because everyone wants to go there~

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.080
Chuu: And I searched it and I found that it is so beautiful!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.500
Yves: I want to go to... Boracay

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.460
Chuu: (T.M.I) Oh! My mom and grand mother are in Boracay now!

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040
Yves: Then why didn't they bring me to Boracay?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.880
(Yves' T.M.J (Too Much Joke))

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.960
(Yves' T.M.J (Too Much Joke))
Yves: I mean, why your mom didn't take me to Boracay even when she went to there

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.100
(Yves couldn't go to Boracay, but they arrived at the Hong Kong and it makes them happy!)

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.980
Chuu: Our members, are you watching it now?
Yves: Watching it now?

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.018
Chuu: We miss you~
