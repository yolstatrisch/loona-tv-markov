00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.760
(JinSoul is dancing on the water!)

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.660
(Her shoes is wet...)

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.760
(Positive) You know, the water splashed when I danced on the water. 
It was fun~

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.340
And... It's dinner time!

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.460
(JinSoul preparing a meal alone...)

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.560
(Suddenly the light turned off!)

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.200
(Happy Birthday, JinSoul!)

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.640
♬Happy birthday dear JinSoul. Happy birthday to you♬

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.520
(To celebrate both her birthday and becoming the seventh member of LOOΠΔ,
they prepared two cakes!)

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.220
I wish everything goes well with LOOΠΔ!

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.720
And... I also wish myself good luck...!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.880
HaSeul: We have to put the cake on her face at least once!

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.980
HaSeul: (Seriuos) You better don't do that to me, YeoJin~

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.340
HaSeul: (Her wish) Um... shall we do that? 'This has been LOOΠΔ?'

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.280
(The 7 released members of LOOΠΔ finally gathered together in front of the camera!)
This has been LOOΠΔ!
