00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.500
HaSeul: How about making a new name for us?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.260
HaSeul: Like YeoSeul~ (YeoJin X HaSeul)
HeeJin: HeeSeul?

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.640
HaSeul: HaJin?
HeeJin: But HaJin's 'Jin' could mean HyunJin’s name.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.740
(If so...?)
HaSeul:Right...

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.040
HeeJin: HaHee…

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.080
(For now, they decide to call themselves 'HaHee'!)

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.860
(HaHee trying to wear a cap, looks like a twin!)

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.160
HaSeul: Do I look like a painter?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.320
(HaSeul is doing art on HeeJin's face like a real painter!)

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.980
(HaSeul is doing art on HeeJin's face like a real painter!)
HaSeul: Hey, hold it~

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.020
(It looks so itchy...doesn't it?)

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.180
(Anyway, don't forget that you're watching Yves' photo shooting...)

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.280
HaSeul: Now Yves is doing a photo shoot, right?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.660
HaSeul: And I've guessed like...
HeeJin: Guess what?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.100
HaSeul: why did her photo shooting start too late?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.180
HeeJin: You mean 'late at night'?
HaSeul: Yes!

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.280
HaSeul: She wore a white dress like a swan when she had a photo shooting last time.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.300
HaSeul: At that time, bright outside!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.380
HaSeul: But now, dark outside!

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.160
(LOONAVERSE which makes even members try to reason!)
HeeJin: Oh~ there's something~
HaSeul: Coexistence between days and nights~

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560
HaSeul: (Although she doesn't know what it is) 
Please looking forward to it!

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.240
(But.. what is this?)
HaSeul: And we should leave now, right?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.260
HaSeul: Oh! It's moving~

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.560
(LOOΠΔ TV PD is making the special wave effect...)
HaSeul: It's moving!
