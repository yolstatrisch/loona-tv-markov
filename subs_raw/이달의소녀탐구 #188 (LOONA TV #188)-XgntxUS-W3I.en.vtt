00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.720
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ/ODD EYE CIRCLE - Starlight"

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.920
(You couldn't just pass the roller coaster!)

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.400
I've never ridden these kind of things before!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.720
I've ridden it before, though it's scary!

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.640
I've never ridden even a pirate ship before. Because it's so scary!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.220
(But you all have to try it this time!)
Choerry: Unbelievable!

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.200
No! No way! It doesn't make any sense!

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.340
Choerry: No way!

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.980
Kim Lip: Oh my...!

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.480
So scary!

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.120
(They get scared.)

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.600
(But the youngest member looks so happy...)

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.360
(And it's time to get off the roller coaster...)

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.520
(But they got one more chance to ride!)
Kim Lip: Why did they give me one more ride... No! I hate!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.880
JInSoul: We don't need to ride it twice!
Kim Lip: I hate!

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.020
(Finally the girls got off the roller coaster after riding twice...)

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.160
JInSoul: We're in LA but...

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.820
JinSoul: We've just got this letter~
Kim Lip: We've got this letter~

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.180
(The fan letter was given to them who were on the way back!)
Thank you!

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.780
JinSoul: You know? It feels like...

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.500
JinSoul: As soon as I arrived at this sea, it's so refreshing!

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.660
Kim Lip: It was really nice to hang out with our members!

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.240
(The first schedule jn LA is complete!)
JinSoul: Right. Also, the weather was so nice today!
