00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.560
Chuu: Hi~

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.920
(The first day of music video shooting!)
Chuu: I'm so curious how the music video will be filmed!

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.000
Olivia Hye: And there is our teacher~

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.200
(She is yyxy's teacher!)

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.360
(And she told Chuu to do something!)

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.060
(Chuu speaking weird and unidentifiable language...)

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.180
(And the teacher is listening to it seriuosly...)

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.120
(Chuu is done with excellent performance!)

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.780
(Does it sound similar?)

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.300
Chuu: I don't know, don't know @#@#$&amp;%$#

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.800
Chuu: I don't know, don't know, don't know~

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.040
(She can do this?)

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.800
Olivia Hye: No...

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.040
Olivia Hye: I can't do it~

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.520
(On the other hand, Go Won can do it!)

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.160
(However Yves priased Go Won's eyebrows instead of her pronounciation)

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.140
Go Won: You have to use your eyebrows when you talk~

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.960
Yves: Wow!

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.300
Go Won: Thanks~
