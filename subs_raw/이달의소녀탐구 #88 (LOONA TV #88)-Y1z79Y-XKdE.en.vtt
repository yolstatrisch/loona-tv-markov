The weather in New Zealand is very changeable

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.920
HeeJin, HaSeul &amp; HyunJin are taking a rest in the shade of tree
HaSeul : Hey, open your eyes big~

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.860
HaSeul : 1

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.200
HyunJin : It’s like Kim Min-kyo~

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.360
She does it again…

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.340
HaSeul : You seem like Sunday~

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.840
HaSeul : You know? It’s Sunday! Please sing “My Sunday” for me, right now!

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.180
HyunJin : (Soulless) You seem like Sunday… Sunday...

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.180
HaSeul : OH… SUNDAY…

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.580
It looks like HaSeul and HyunJin definitely got some sickness by heat!

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.420
HeeJin : The staffs are standing at the center of the playground. 
What if we have to stand at there like them?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.720
HaSeul : (Positive again!) I’ll do my best even though I fall down!

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.640
Fortunately, they didn’t fall down until the end of filming MV

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.080
HeeJin : Right now.. every shooting in New Zealand is done~

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.520
HyunJin : But ViVi moved to other site for filming her solo scene.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.800
Everyone will take a rest except ViVi
HyunJin : Fighting!

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.100
Everyone will take a rest except ViVi
HeeJin : Cheer up!

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.360
ViVI is working hard!

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.220
HeeJin, HyunJin &amp; HaSeul : Good job everyone!

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.160
