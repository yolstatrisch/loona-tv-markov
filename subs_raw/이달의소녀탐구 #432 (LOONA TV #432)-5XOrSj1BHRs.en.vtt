00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.800
(A day before [LOONAbirth] concert!)

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.740
(LOOΠΔ members getting off the car!)

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.000
(The waiting room has big space enough for 12 members)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.560
'What made you guys dress up so nicely?'

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.620
Chuu: Because today is the day of rehearsal~
YeoJin: It's rehearsal!

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.200
YeoJin: That's the reason we dressed up like this~

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.620
Yves: Look around, this waiting room is very nice, right?
Kim Lip: Right~

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.260
Chuu: It's spacious and clean~

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560
(The waiting room has SWAG like LOOΠΔ's reputation as a rookie!)

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.880
Yves: I can hear our song right now~

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.120
Yves: I'm very excited and I want to do it as soon as possible!
Kim Lip: Yeah~

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.120
(And they are in their very best condition!)

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.880
YeoJin: I didn't expect that some fans are waiting for us

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.020
YeoJin: Even though it's not the day of concert

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.380
YeoJin: So I was very touched~

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.960
YeoJin: I think you guys also agree to this, right?
Yves: Of course~

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.120
Yves: She's the MC

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.820
Chuu: The greatest MC!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.420
YeoJin: Look at the reaction, they are always so kind~

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.960
(Okay, YeoJin!)
