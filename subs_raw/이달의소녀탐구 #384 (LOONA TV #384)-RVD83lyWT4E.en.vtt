All: Hello~

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.900
Yves: We, the tall girls, finished a photo shoot

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.440
Yves: And short members will do...

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.060
(Please call them LOOΠΔ Line unit!)
Kim Lip &amp; JinSoul: Short!

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.800
(At that instant, LOOΠΔ Line unit suddenly appears!)

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.520
Yves: Let's do a dance battle!

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.680
Yves: Bring your boss here!

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.960
(Anyway, the dance battle has started!)

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.760
(Here comes boss Go Won!)
HaSeul: Our boss is Go Won

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.360

Kim Lip: Let me show you our boss

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.560
Kim Lip: It's Jeon HeeJin

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.160
(And the dance moves HeeJin does looks a little violent...)

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.700
(Anyway, they are back to their job after the short dance battle!)

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.220

HaSeul: The photo shooting is done finally!

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.720

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.240

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.660

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.120
'Let's eat chicken after all the work is done!'

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.280

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.018
