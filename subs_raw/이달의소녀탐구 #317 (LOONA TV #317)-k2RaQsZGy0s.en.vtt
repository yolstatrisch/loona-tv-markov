(While Olivia Hye preparing a photo shoot)

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.460
(What are other members doing?)

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.940
Chuu: Feeling great~

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.240
Chuu: It's a nice day, isn't it?
Yves: It's really great~

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.760
Go Won: What are you guys doing?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.940
Chuu: Feeling spring~

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.660
Go Won: Click!

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.140
Go Won: It feels like spring is really coming!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.120
Yves: Right, cause I'm dragging spring here like this!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.400
Go Won: Amazing!

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.440
Go Won: You know, the atmosphere of here is like too much winter!

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.340
Go Won: You failed!

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.300
(Found a telephone!)

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
Chuu: 0...

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.480
Chuu: How can I use this...?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.360
(She might've never seen a telephone like this...)

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.620
(Don't need to push buttons. It's rotary dial phone.)

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.860
(She is making a phone call to...)

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.100
Chuu: Hello~

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.620
Chuu: Mommy~

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.860
Chuu: Alright!

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.360
Chuu: She said 'don't skip a meal'

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.960
Chuu: 'And good luck with your shooting'

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.180
Yves: She said all of that even in that short time?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.580
Yves: Is she a rapper?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.280
Yves: Please edit it in a fun way with using some sound effects!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.780
Chuu: Chuu, take

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.380
Chuu: C A R E

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.100
Chuu: and always try your best!

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.960
Go Won: Take care~

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.660
Go Won: Try your best~

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.580
(I tried my best, too...)

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.820
(End with Chuu's own sound effects!)
