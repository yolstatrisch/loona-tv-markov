00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.900
(Kim Lip making some strange sound in the corner)

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.620
Yves: Garglin~ Strong!
(*Graglin is a mouthwash product in Korea)

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.780
Kim Lip: My mouth hurts

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.020
Yves: This is my first time to use it after I bought it

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860
Yves: And it's... 
Kim Lip: I'm about to cry...

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.720
Yves: Oh, is it a commercial?
Kim Lip: Then we have to be patient!

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760
(What if LOOΠΔ shoots a commercial for a mouthwash product?)

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.880
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ - favOriTe"

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.500
Yves: It looks like an alcohol commercial, doesn't it?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.320
Kim Lip: Garglin?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.640
Kim Lip: Hey, why does this Garglin look....

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.780
Kim Lip: Look transparent?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.160
Yves: That's how it is normally~

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.180
Kim Lip: Oh, really?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.400
Yves: Right. You didn't know?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.900
Kim Lip: Yes!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.580
Yves: Don't you think it looks familiar?

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.780
Yves: I think I've seen it before

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.000
Kim Lip: Me too

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.180
Yves: Please pour some mouthwash

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.840
Kim Lip: Yes!

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320
(Two hands?)

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.340
Kim Lip: Ah, why did you use two hands?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.200
Yves: And I even swallowed it!

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.720
Yves: Mouthwash should be strong like this!

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.420
(Everyone, don't get it wrong. It's just acting)

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.180
Kim Lip: I think we will get another commercial, not a mouthwash.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.200
Yves: Please don't edit it out!

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200
Kim Lip: Bye~

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.600
Yves: We're adult, aren't we?
Kim Lip: Right!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.420
(ADULT!)

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.018
Yves: See you~
