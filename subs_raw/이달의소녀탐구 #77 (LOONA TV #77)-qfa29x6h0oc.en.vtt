00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.420
The night of Christmas in Taiwan!

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.640
HaSeul: YeoJin is sleeping!
HeeJin: Sleeping~

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.540
'I think YeoJin is exhausted~'

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.580
The youngest member YeoJin is sleeping like a baby bird in a car!

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.140
HaSeul: HeeJin, where are we?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.580
HeeJin: It’s Jiufen!

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.340
The other members made time to tour famous landmarks in Taiwan!

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.740
As expected, the girls main concern is food!
HeeJin: Wow! What is this? It looks so good!

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.940
But they seem too young to eat sticky tofu…
HeeJin: I think it looks good too!
HaSeul: Hey! It’s sticky tofu!

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.500
HeeJin: We decided to choose just one food that really want to eat…

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.360
HyunJin: (Global acting cute) Please give me a lot!

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.320
HeeJin: Ippa…

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.780
HeeJin: Ah, ‘Ippai’ is Japanese… 
HyunJin: A lot!

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.840
The girls picked the Taiwanese fried chicken!

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.560
'Thank you~'

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.520
It’s great!

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.060
But suddenly a Christmas carol is playing in the background…

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.920
HeeJin: Everyone, today is Christmas day~

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.140
HyunJin: Oh no~

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.000
HeeJin: You forgot it, right?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.860
HyunJin: I’ve forgot again today is Christmas…
