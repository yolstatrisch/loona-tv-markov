First filming scene of the second day is Yves’ solo dance scene!

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.820
Yves: I don’t know well...

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.160
Yves: But I think it’s gonna be a solo dance scene.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.340
Yves: Because the whole place look like that and there is a ballet bar

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.300
Yves: Solo dance scene!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.660
Yves’ dance fills the entire space of the studio.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.560
HaSeul: Hi, Yves~

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
HaSeul: We’re monitoring you diligently downstairs~
Kim Lip: Definitely!

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.900
Yves: Aren’t you hanging out?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.420
HaSeul: (Embarrassed) No way~ We didn’t hang out~
Kim Lip: No, no~

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.540
HaSeul: You looked really pretty in the monitor
Kim Lip: I saw, too. You looked nice~

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.560
KIm Lip: Like a ballerina.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.700
Kim Lip: How can I say…

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.760
Kim LIp: Like a girl who chases the dream~

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.140
Yves: Because we’re girls

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.880
(Conclusion: We’re girls!)

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.380
(Taking a commemorative photograph!)

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.900
(But.. there’s just a little height difference between them…)
'HaSeul, stand on your toes'
