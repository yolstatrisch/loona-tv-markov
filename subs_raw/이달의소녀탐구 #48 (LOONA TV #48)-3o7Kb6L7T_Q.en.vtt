00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.760
The second day morning in Iceland… 
HaSeul arrived a place close to the sea and the glaciers

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.300
'A seal is… in front of here…'

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.500
'But I can’t see them.. because of my make up and hair setting…'

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.100
'Shall we put up an umbrella and go outside together?'

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.640
'Pardon?'

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.060
'Shall we put up an umbrella and go outside together?'

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.740
'Yes!'

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.020
The special suggest to HaSeul who really want to see a seal!

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.240
Can HaSeul meet a seal?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.080
'A Seal..'

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.520
'Where is a seal? already gone?'

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.080
'Look at that! A Seal!!'

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.800
Two seals are playing just in front of a filming site!

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.940
'Hello~~'

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.520
But they got into the water as soon as HaSeul called them.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.360
'SEALLL~~~!!!'
