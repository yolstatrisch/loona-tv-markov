(YeoJin is spreading her 'hot pack dance!')
YeoJin: Please follow me. Do steps like me!

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.640
YeoJin: Hurry up!

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.620
HyunJIn: Do we have to do with the steps?
YeoJin: Of course!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.180
HaSeul: Okay, fine!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.200
YeoJin: Saranghandei (I love you)

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.820

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.440
HeeJin: We're learning dialect.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.580
HaSeul: HeeJin's father speaks dialect so well!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.260
HeeJin: When he picks up the phone,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.260
HeeJin: He is like 'Yi? No way~'
*'Yi' means 'Yes' in Chungcheong-do dialect.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.980
HeeJin: So members like my father so much.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.720
HaSeul: So, how about to do a new year's greeting to all of our parents?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.260
HeeJin: And to the fans!
HaSeul: Right, also to the fans!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.840
(Suddenly?)
All: Happy new year~

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.080
(And they are speaking it in local accent...)

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.460
HaSeul: How should I speak local dialect fluently?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.060
#NowPlaying "LOOΠΔ 1/3 - Valentine Girl"

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
(So HaSeul decided to show her talent instead of speaking dialect)

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.800
YeoJin: That's not!
