00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.780
It's

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.760
Almost almost almost...

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.540
Done!

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.500
I'll do my best to the end!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.120
So please watch over me!

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.920
Me and Choerry became trainees at the same time.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.075
She lived close me,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.180
so we took bus together when we commute.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.760
Sometimes she asked me like 'HaSeul, can we debut?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.860
And I said 'I think we can do it~'

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.380
So I felt kind of strange when I heard Choerry will be the next member of LOOΠΔ.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.660
Because it feels like my real sibling debuts.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.460
YeoJin: No! You're sibling is me!

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.720
HaSeul: Nope! My sibling is 'OO Cho'!!

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.000
HaSeul: It's a boy!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.140
(Choerry's photo shooting is still continuing!)

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.280
(And HaSeul taking a picuture of Choerry like her real sister.)
