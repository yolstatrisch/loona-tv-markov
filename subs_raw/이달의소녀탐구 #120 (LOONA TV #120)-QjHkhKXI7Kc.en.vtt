ViVi : If you don't play the rock-paper-scissors game,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.600
HaSeul : Yes, I will eat alone

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.220
ViVi : If you win the game, everyone can eat a pizza

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.280
ViVi : But if you lose, you even can't eat too!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.840
(ViVi understands the rule perfectly)

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.620
'Shall we play now?'

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.900
HaSeul : Yes

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.720
HyunJin : Rock-paper-scissors!

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.060
(The first game ended in a tie!)

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.500
(Second round!)
'Rock-paper-scissors!'

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.680
(The second game ended in a tie, again!)

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.720
(The pizza game is getting more interesting!)

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.940
HyunJin : Rock-paper-scissors!

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.320
The winner is LOOΠΔ 1/3!!

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.600
(It's the most moving moment to LOOΠΔ 1/3)

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.520
HaSeul : Come on, LOOΠΔ!!

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.540
(Group hug!)

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.760
HaSeul : As the leader of LOOΠΔ 1/3, I always have a responsibility to our members...

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.760
(It's time to eat a pizza!)

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180
(they are enjoying some pizza)

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.660
HyunJin : It's just a little salty...

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.809
HaSeul : This tastes just like a foreign pizza
