Yves: The first day of shooting of Olivia Hye's music video!

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.020
Go Won: She is preparing behind us!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.620
(Right behind us!)

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.040
Yves: You know,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.840
Yves: Making your amount of footage is a little difficult when you're the main character of LOOΠΔ TV

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.500
Yves: However, after your era's gone,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.820
Yves: It would be a little bit easier to appear in.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.940
Yves: I've got to go. See you!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.400
Chuu: So, two of us are here!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.900
Chuu: It's a happy day!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.400
Chuu: Because the weather is so fine outside!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.860

(Is it fine?)

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.360
Chuu: I'm sure that filming outside will be difficult...

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.460
Olivia Hye: Look at that!

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.060
Chuu: You have to learn this.
Go Won: You have to do that when you are filming your music video!

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.620
Olivia Hye: (Wolf's pride) Wolfs don't do that.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.720
Go Won: What? This is totally wolf's.
Chuu: Definitely wolf's!

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.700
Chuu: Your lips look gorgeous today!
Olivia Hye: Yeah~
