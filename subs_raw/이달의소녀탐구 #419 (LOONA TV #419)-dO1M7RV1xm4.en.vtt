00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.280
JinSoul: Finally, it's my turn

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.340
(LOOΠΔ members ran a lot on that day!)

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.100
(Run... run... and run again....)

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.060
JinSoul: It's been a while since I ran last time.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.880
JInSoul: Running while filming the music video for 'Singing in the Rain' was the last time.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.160
JinSoul: It was fine because of the weather was little cold~

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.100
JinSoul: However I'm sweating so much because it's too hot...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.140
JinSoul: But I think after I run a lot like this...

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.360
JinSoul: I'm going to lose weight!

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.540
(Taking JinSoul's image cut!)

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.060
(Look at her face... it's the facial expression when you get into your beauty!)

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.420
JinSoul: it's the first time I filmed a music video as a last one!

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.420
JinSoul: Actually, filming as the last is not that easy~

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.480
JinSoul: However! I feel so reassured

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.600
JinSoul: Because HeeJin and Kim Lip are waiting for me in the car

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.700
JinSoul: All the staffs and employees worked really hard even in this hot weather

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.540
JinSoul: So I'd like to say thank you for your hard work

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.640
JinSoul: See you~

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.960
(Please stay tuned for more episodes from the last day of 'Hi High' music video filming!
