(HaSeul warming up in the hallway)

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.180
HaSeul: I wrote that ‘singing vocal music is my speciality’

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.180
HaSeul: So.. they’re going to ask me to sing opera!

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.900
HaSeul: I don’t want to let people down.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.000
HaSeul: So that’s the reason why I have been practicing!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.080
(Practicing again!)

Kim Lip: Do you hear something?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.540
Kim Lip: Suddenly they started…

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.500
Kim Lip: Where are we? Is it an opera house?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.120
Chuu: Hey, we learned it from school!

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.960
(All the girls are singing opera!)

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.720
HaSeul: This is the typical situation when I’m singing opera

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.960
HaSeul: All the people around me sing it almost 15 minutes

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.240
HaSeul: I think they’re amazed by it.
