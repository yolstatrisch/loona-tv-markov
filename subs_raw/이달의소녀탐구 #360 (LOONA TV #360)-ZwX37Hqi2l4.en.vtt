00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.740
(LOOΠΔ 1/3 doing a rehearsal!)

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.860
(And there are YeoJin and Choerry watching it beside the stage!)

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.180
Choerry: It's your first performance ever! How do you feel?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.120
YeoJin: I feel great

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.660
(However she looks very nervous about her first performance!)

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.620
(She's preparing the first ever performance for 'Kiss Later' carefully)

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.140
(And there is a person watching her from the audience setas!)

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.380
JinSoul: You know, YeoJin has never done any promotion yet.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.200
JinSoul: I was worried about that...

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.960
JinSoul: So I'm here to do monitor for her!

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.020
(She's supporting her!)

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.640
JinSoul: I think she's nervous because I saw her eyes were shaking

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.200
JinSoul: However I guess she belongs to the stage, definitely.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
JinSoul: I'm sure that she's going to do great on the stage for the fan meeting today.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.920
JinSoul: You can do well, right?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.880
JinSoul: Actually I've never seen that she's speaking in a calm voice like that~
