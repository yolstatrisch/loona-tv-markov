00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.840
(ViVi practicing the choreography of ‘Hi High’ while Chuu and Go Won are filming!)

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.480
ViVI: Maybe group dance scene for verse 1 will be done tomorrow

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.740
ViVI: So I’m little nervous right now~

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.620
ViVI: I have to be getting used to it so…

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.060
(When you need to be getting used to something, do like ooh-ah ooh ah...)

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
(ViVi the robot is getting better with a choreography)

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.080
ViVI: I think the last line of our song is little

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.220
ViVi: cute, right?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.080
(LOOΠΔ’s very own unique style of lyrics!)
ViVi: Like kimbap, you’re like dumplings, so sweet

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.300
ViVI: However I had never expected~

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.460
ViVi: That Kimbap and dumplings will be included in the lyrics

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.920
ViVi: So when we made the choreography, we tried to put some special moves like this…

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.700
(For example?)
ViVi: Like kimbap, you’re like dumplings~

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.220
ViVi: But we needed to make it more cute and beautiful~

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.260
ViVi: So, the final version of the choreography looks a lot more neat, I think!
