00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.780
(The morning of the second day!)

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.180
(There are a lot of flower petals in a park in Budapest)

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.760
Go Won: Oh~ You~

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760
Go Won: No~

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.660
Olivia Hye: I guess she doesn’t like me...

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.020
Go Won: See you at Seoul~

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.800
(Look at that strong dandelion!)

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.260
Olivia Hye: You’re pretty strong~

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.300
(Her dandelion is not as strong as Olivia Hye’s)

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.920
Chuu: Sorry~

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.760
(She finds the forest of dandelions!)

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.560
‘Hey~ Chuu~’

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.660
‘I told you the seeds are flying over here because of you~!’

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.160
Chuu: Ok then. I’m going to blow away it here~

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.580
Chuu: I’m done!

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.560
Chuu: I blow them into the air and then they will be flown away to South Korea!

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
(Dandelions are also good to use as props!)

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.380
