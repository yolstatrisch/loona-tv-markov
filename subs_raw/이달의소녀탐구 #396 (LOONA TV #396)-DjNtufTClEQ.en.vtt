00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.220
Olivia Hye: It's the first day of a music video shooting~

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.100
Olivia Hye: So just 5 members came here~

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.260

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000
Chuu: I think it's just...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800
Chuu: Eating lunch box on the grass will be great... It's just my hope~

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.440
(It's only Chuu's wishful thinking! Now we have to shoot a music video!)

Go Won: The acting that I did just a while ago was like...

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.460
Go Won: Open the door and think like 'Well... should I go in?'

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.460
Go Won: Hungary! It's like I'm back to Hungray...

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.260
Go Won: Maybe...

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.620
(She has nothing much to say anymore...)

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.099
Go Won: (Jumping to a conclusion) Anyway, that's what happened~
