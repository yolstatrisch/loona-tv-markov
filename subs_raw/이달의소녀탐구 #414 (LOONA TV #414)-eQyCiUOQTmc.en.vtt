00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.020
(HyunJin practicing a facial expression so hard!)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.000
(Her natural born gag instinct that can't be hidden...)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.820
(Her natural born gag instinct that can't be hidden...)
HyunJin: What are you doing tomorrow evening?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.560
(Of course her beauty isn't going anywhere!)

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.380
(And she doesn't forget to do a joke...)

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.800
(Nobody is hearing what she's talking, but she is doing her best for LOOΠΔ TV...)

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.760
(One more joke?)

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.880
HyunJin: There's nothing I can do more~~

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.660
(The time stole by like an arrow and It's AM 2:40)

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.500
(Let's go home!)

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.780
YeoJin: Hello, but it's time to go so I changed into the casual clothes~

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.500
YeoJin: Where am I going?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700
YeoJin: Our home~

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.120
(Olivia Hye's awkward smile...)

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.580
Olivia Hye: Oh... Are you really shooting me right now? In casual clothes?

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.900
YeoJin: Stop! Don't shoot her! Because she's wearing mismatched shoes!

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.140
(However YeoJin keep talking about it in front of the camera)
YeoJin: The mismatched shoes! She was like 'what?'

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.780
Olivia Hye: Look~

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.240
Olivia Hye: I was so busy in morning so I wore mismatched shoes~

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.420
(Although she wore mismatched shoes, the music video filming is done successfully)
