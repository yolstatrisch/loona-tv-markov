00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.800
When HeeJin went to Paris...
'Je m'appelle HeeJin' 
(My name is HeeJin)

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.720
Another girl was there...

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.100
Another girl was there...
'What are you doing!'

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.140
'Everythis is wonderful to HyunJin...'

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.380
'The airplane...'

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.960
'Wait a munites~!'

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.220
'What do you want to buy, HyunJin?'

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.100
'ROYCE Chocolate!'

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.800
'She is the girl who has the exact purpose!'

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.820
Can she buy the chocolate what she wants?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.640
But unfortunately, ROYCE Chocolate was not in Incheon International Airport...

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.060
'How...'

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.240
'How could this be??'

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.920
So HyunJin bought another chocoate!

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.300
The girls ate them all as soon as they bought the choloate.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720
Their character is a short temper...

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.880
They've polished off a whole box of chocolate!

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.080
But one thing left on HyunJin's head.
Maybe she will eat that when she feels hungry!
