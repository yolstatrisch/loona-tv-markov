00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.700
Chuu: Today is the shooting day for the teaser video~

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
(So could we see the behind the scene of their teaser, finally?)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.400
(No! They will eat the meal, first!)
Chuu: What you want to eat?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.160
(No! They will eat the meal, first!)
Yves: I want to eat some spicy

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.060
(No! They will eat the meal, first!)
Chuu: Spicy?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.760
Yves: We took food recommendation and this is the result! Hong Kong style noodle!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.820
(So will they film the teaser after they eat all this food?)
Chuu: Looks delicious!

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.720
Yves: (Dessert) It's out!

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.040
(It's like a LOOΠΔ TV for Hong Kong food...)

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.800
Chuu: It's hot!

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
(They are done eating! It's time to film!)

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
(Shall we watch Yves and Chuu's butterfly-like dance?)

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.120
(Here comes Chuu!)

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.040
(Their eyes look way too different from when they eat something)
