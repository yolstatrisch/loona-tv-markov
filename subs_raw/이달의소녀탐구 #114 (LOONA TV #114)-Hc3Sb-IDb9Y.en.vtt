HeeJin : Right, we're going to Czech!

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.520

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.140
HeeJin : C(ze) - Czech, I'm coming to you

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.220
HeeJin : Yeah, right

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.460
(Lastly, it's HaSeul's turn!)
HeeJin : 'Czech' acrotic poem!

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.460
HaSeul : I'm not really good at making a po...

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.260
HeeJin : C !!

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.540

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.460
HaSeul : C(ze) - Check! Check!

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.140

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.560
HaSeul : C(h) - Co~ Co~ Co~

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.320
(They're not funny but cute...)

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.280
HeeJin : They're really no funny...

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.320
HeeJin : No jam~~

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.180
(The no jam girls went back to sleep...)

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.640
(In the meantime, LOOΠΔ 1/3 has arrived at Prague, Czech!!!!)
