(Hello, Chuu!)

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.060
Yves: It's expensive floor, right?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.960
Yves: You can't put your foot on here like this...
Chuu: Yes!

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.180
Chuu: This marble floor remind me of stone-plate-grilled egg...

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.800
Yves: Hey guys, stone-grilled!

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.720
(Don't talk at the same time...)

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.660
Chuu: I recommend you to eat stone-plate grilled food!

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.700
(Go Won dancing on the stone-plate floor!)

Go Won: Hi!
ViVi: Did you do well?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
(ViVi is saying something to her!)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.920
Go Won: Pardon?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.780
ViVi: You looked like a doll!
Go Won: Oh, really?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.240
Go Won: (Bragging) I put this kind of thing on my wrist!
Yves: Good

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.320
Go Won: There is a kind of problem wit sound...

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.040
(Chuu hugging Go Won!)
Go Won: So we're waiting for fix to it.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.380
ViVi: I think..

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.920
ViVi: Go Won will be more bright

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.740
ViVi: If she will hang out with Chuu more often~

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.960
(Also ViVi likes Chuu &amp; Go Won's combination!)
