00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.720
(Do you remember the pool scene from ‘Love Cherry Motion’ MV?)

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.400
(But the reality is…)

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.300
MV Director: Can you go in the pool now?
HaSeul &amp; YeoJin: Sure!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.800
(After the raining, the filming restarted…)

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.560
(But it seems they don’t like playing pool…)

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.820
YeoJin: It's not working the way I want!

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.500
HaSeul: But actually I'm really scared of water...

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.660
(HaSeul has both a fear of bird and water…)
Choerry: I won't do that!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.500
(Time to dive!)

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.220
(YeoJin &amp; Choerry are diving into the water without any hesitation!)

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.660
(But with help from the tube, HaSeul also succeeded!)

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.240
(The filming is under way anyway…)

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.680
Kim Lip: I like water…

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920
Kim Lip: That looks fun… I wish I could join them…

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.660
‘MV shooting in Iceland and diving into the water.
Which one is more difficult for you?’

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.360
HaSeul: I think diving is more…

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.060
HaSeul: But it’s not bad...

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.200
HaSeul: Because I think I’ve overcome a fear of water slightly…
