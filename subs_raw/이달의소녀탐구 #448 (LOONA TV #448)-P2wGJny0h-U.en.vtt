00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.360
HaSeul: O.E.C sent this message 'Who are you? What are you wearing?'

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.340
HaSeul: So ViVi answered like this...

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.180
HaSeul: 'Vi'

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.840
HaSeul: and then she texted 'An angel-like clothes'

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.720
HeeJin: It's a kind of ordinary phone conversation between 1/3 and O.E.C

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.460
(Their clothes really look like an angel dress!)

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.140
HeeJin: Your clothes could be an angel dress with a little change!

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.900
HeeJin: Please show us!

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.400
HeeJin: You should raise your shoulders, ViVi~

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.600
(Angel ViVi who has muscular shoulders!)

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.080
HaSeul: She's an angel, not a pigeon~

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.020
ViVi: If I'm a pigeon

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.220
(Vigeon's attack!)

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.980
(HeeJin accidentally made eye contact with a fan who is entering the concert hall!)

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.100
HeeJin: I should be careful, right?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.180
HeeJin: I'm never going to touch the curtains again~

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.500
HyunJin: The only thing left to do is to go to the stage~

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.380
(Stretching facial muscles before going on stage!)

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.160
HaSeul: Jeon.Kim.Jo.Hwang~

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.800
HeeJin: Jeon!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.220
(HyunJin was a bit late)
HyunJin: Kim!

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.880
HeeJin: Jeon!

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.660
(HyunJin was a bit fast)
HyunJin: Kim!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.940
HeeJin: Jeon!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.440
HyunJin: Kim!

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.000
HaSeul: Jo!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.500
ViVi: Hwang!

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.660
(Jeon.Kim.Jo.Hwag, fighting~)

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.660
HaSeul: We're not like-minded~

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.040
(Finally LOOΠΔ Jeon.Kim.Jo.Hwang go up to the stage!)

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.240
All: We're LOOΠΔ 1/3~
