00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.740
(Go Won feeling HaSeul's warmth left in this airplane)

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.400
Olivia Hye: The ceilng is lower than I expected

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
(She's laughing without any words...)

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.060
Olivia Hye: She lost her words...

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.740
Olivia Hye: Actually, I was supposed to care Go Won today~

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.460
Olivia Hye: But I couldn't do...

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.520
Olivia Hye: They gave me a hot tea to drink~

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.300
(But looks exactly like udon soup...)
Olivia Hye: It looks like udon soup, but it's really hot tea~

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.440
(Olivia Hye caring Go Won after the shooting is done!)

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.220
Olivia Hey: It's done~
Go Won: Right, it's done~

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
Go Won: At first, I thought 'it's not as cold as I expected'

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.120
Olivia Hye: It's really cold~

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.260
Go Won: But it's ended very quickly~

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.720
(But it was only Go Won's thought!)

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.020
(Actually the hardest part of the shooting was left...)

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.180
(Go Won going across Iceland alone!)

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200
(She has run a long time and it's fast forwarded, but it's far from over)

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.860
Go Won: I wonder why we keep running always

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.680
Go Won: Is it a part of LOOΠΔVERSE? I mean, running

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.040
'Of course!'
