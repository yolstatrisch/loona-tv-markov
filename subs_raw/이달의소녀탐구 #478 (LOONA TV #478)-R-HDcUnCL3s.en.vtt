00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.100
Yves: I'm here to eat some food~

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.120
Chuu: This restaurant is very crowded~

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.100
Yves &amp; Chuu: Thanks for the food~

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.640
(How does Hong Kong dumpling taste like?)

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.720
Yves: (Of course) Dumpling taste!

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.500
Chuu: Dumpling taste!

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.360
Yves: It's like a dumpling marinated with soy sauce!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.880
Yves: Delicoius!

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.260
Yves: I ate it all~

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.860
(Drinking cola to get rid of a little bit greasy taste)

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.680
(R.I.P Hong Kong Dumpling)

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.760
(Doing some sightseeing after the meal!)

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.480
Yves: Look, there are so many Chuu, 1, 2, 3

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.780
(Pigs are not connected with LOOΠΔ's own universe (maybe))

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.500
Yves: (Including Chuu) 8 pigs

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.040
Chuu: (Including Yves) 9 pigs~

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.080
Yves: It's violence!

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.540
Yves: Chuu and Yves are back!

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.720
Chuu: I think it will be hard to pick suitable videos for LOOΠΔ TV because we took a lot of videos

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.260
(Anyway, it's time to take a selfie!)

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.000
(That selfies would be beautiful because they're beautiful...)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.960
(And they are holding each other's hair)

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.900
Chuu: Look!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.020
Chuu: Do you think it's a good footage for LOOΠΔ TV?

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.040
(Judgement is up to Orbit....)
